Rather, some of them show not much interest in the crypto community or are even discouraging this world.\r\nTwitter CFO, for example, stated multiple times in his declaration about discouraging any crypto investments as quoted on The Wall Street Journal:\r\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-cfo-says-investing-in-cryptodoesnt-make-sense -right-now-11637027310\r\nNowadays, the most used platforms inside the crypto industry are Twitter, Discord and Telegram.\r\nUnfortunately, these platforms often appeared to be hostile towards the crypto community users, limiting the circulating informations and the general freedom of speech. Twitter for example, after a long campaign of hacked accounts in the past, decided to close and ban Elon Musk's account after he tweeted his opinion about bitcoin with the excuse of \"possible account hijack\".\r\n \r\nRising of social activities with disinformation and risk of loss\r\nMusk, after complained about this behavior as stated in this BBC article talking about this unfortunate event: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45953747\r\nTwitter adopts harsh solutions for no reason but, on the other hand, does not protect users from fake news, scam advertisements and intentional manipulation of the general informations.\r\nThere are many examples talking about fake crypto projects, scams, rugpull and other illicit activities carried and marketed inside these platforms as told by the following news from the IndiaTimes:\r\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/a-crypto-scam-is-brewing-on-twitter-and-social-media-atlarge/arti cleshow/81120014.cms\r\nBeside censorship, sometimes these centralized platforms like Telegram or Discord are used for fraudulent events, such as hacking control panels due to their configurable structure for developers, bot integration and similar.\r\nLot of crypto community groups full of people are left with no protection and no overview about the validity of any information circulating inside.\r\nIt's very easy for hackers or fraudulent criminals to carry scams using malicious bots, impersonation and phishing techniques.\r\nThere are a lot of references about this behavior as shown in the following article as example: \r\nhttps://threatpost.com/telegram-stealcrypto-wallet-credentials/177266/\r\nRising of social activities with disinformation and risk of loss\r\nWe all have seen many examples of how fake news and disinformation can easily spread over the net in just a matter of minutes.\r\nThis can be easily applied to the world of investments and crypto in particular: Scam advertisements, fake accounts to impersonate influencers, fake news and pump&dump techniques have been carried with success over the social network platforms during the last 5 years.\r\nAll of this is possible due to weak control policies applied by the social platforms that don't protect the data integrity and truthfulness, leaving the users exposed to fake and blind hype, disinformation and untrustworthy information providers.\r\nThis lack of integrity control often leads to potential losses and risks involved with disinformation and manipulation. In the far-west of informations, people struggle \r\nto understand who to follow with trust or where the real truth dwells.\r\nCrokt aims to solve this problem creating a safe and reliable place where to be informed, without letting the users alone in their journey.\r\nAccording to a survey, 99.1% of the crypto investors and traders interviewed would rather prefer to have an unique stable application to handle all the information, analysis, share and storage of their digital crypto assets.\r\nCrokt aims to cover exactly this need, providing an unique all-inone solution for all the crypto lovers.\r\nMore than 100 million people around the world are now using cryptocurrencies - and a growing number of baby boomers and  Gen Xers are becoming interested in bitcoin and other tokens, according to two separate reports. A report from exchange Crypto.com estimated that there were 106 million crypto users around the world in January 2021, following a 16% jump in participants that month alone. A separate survey from financial advisory group deVere found 70% of its clients aged over 55 had already invested in digital currencies, or were planning to do so, in 2021, despite bitcoin and others being strongly associated with younger, millennial investors.\u201d \r\nBusiness Insider In January 2022, total crypto holders appear to be around 300 millions: https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership\r\nThese numbers are insanely high and they keep increasing every single day. Hundreds of thousands of people become new crypto holders and investors every day. We\u2019ve all been new in the crypto world, and the main questions at the beginning are:\r\n-  Which platforms do I need to use?\r\n-  Where can I join the communities?\r\n-  Who do I follow on twitter?\r\n-  Where do I see the news?\r\n-  Where do I find telegram links for joining crypto groups?\r\n-  Where do I see the charts?\r\n-  Is this crypto going up? Is this a good moment to buy/sell?\r\nThe main problems for new crypto investors\r\nMost of the new crypto users stated they feel alone when entering the crypto market, without having a place to feel safe and interact with other people. This will result in disinformation, loss of capitals and so on.\r\nWe\u2019ve created Crokt to solve this BIG problem.\r\nWe\u2019ll finally merge all the crypto community, to an all-in-one decentralized platform.\r\nCrokt platform is 100% dedicated to the crypto community and specifically designed for it, investors will never feel alone again.\r\nYou\u2019re a crypto investor? Download Crokt, follow the suggestions we give you thanks to our algorithm or follow your friends and traders, check out some news, join the public groups and talk with other users, create the wallet and start investing safely.\r\nCrokt will be the biggest landmark for every crypto user within the end of 2022.\r\nSAFETY FIRST\r\nBeing a decentralized platform, Crokt will NEVER steal its users' information.\r\nWhile every other Social Network does, we will never ask for your personal data to use the platform.\r\nNo Cookies inside Crokt.\r\nWe think cyber security should be the rule number one for every kind of platform and our main goal is to protect the safety of every single user.\r\nEvery chat or post is safely encrypted and no one will ever have access to it, neither us.\r\nEvery user will have its own freedom of speech, we will never ban or mute users for sharing their thoughts and ideas.\r\nWe will only intervene in case of scams or something that could expose our users at risk.\r\nThe Crokt project aims to promote the use of blockchain technology as a fast, reliable and low-cost payment gateway to guarantee verified tamper-proof transactions on the nature of a decentralized distributed system.\r\nCrokt crypto token is designed to be a fast and low-fee internal payment and utility gateway for services related to the Crokt ecosystem.\r\nThe project of Crokt uses the blockchain as a clean technology to create the first safe and reliable social platform with an active and sustainable ecosystem.\r\nThe Crokt project is open source, as it is the smart contract inside the blockchain.\r\nAll the Crokt development integrations come with open source solutions for developers and third party softwares. Crokt token also focuses on privacy of the transactions: In the blockchain system, although all data logging and operation updates are made public to the whole network node, all transaction informations are handled by hash encryption which allows almost anonymous data exchange.\r\nBlockchain is one of the most discussed technologies nowadays as a potential successor of the internet. The blockchain combines a set of existing technologies, including distributed peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanism and encryption algorithm, to introduce a new way of data formation, transmission, storage and usage.\r\nThe breakthroughs brought by blockchain technology has the potential to change the existing economic and financial mode of operation.\r\nIn a few years this system is even leading to a new technological innovation and industrial change on a global scale.\r\nA blockchain is a tamper-proof and decentralized data structure that joins data blocks chronologically. The nature of the blockchain is a distributed system that serves as the underlying technology for digital assets and for a distributed, encrypted and reliable accounting and clearing system.\r\n \r\nIn this initial phase Crokt will rely on the Ethereum blockchain blockchain technology as main internal circuit for its token but we plan to launch our own Crokt decentralized chain in the future: despite the fact that the ETHEREUM is one of the most secure and widelyused blockchain for tokenization, Crokt aims to create a completely innovative custom blockchain that could allow users to tokenize user's projects inside the Crokt ecosystem.\r\nThe Internet has been one of the most revolutionary and disruptive technologies in history, creating one of the biggest paradigm shifts of all time.\r\nThe advent of the internet has drastically changed the way people invest and opened new gates of personal finance to many around the world.\r\nThe Internet has had a profound impact on the way that consumers listen to music, watch movies, buy and sell products, and communicate. \r\nIt has also had hugely beneficial or malefic impacts when it came to investing, stocks and assets, company scandals and real time market news.\r\nDuring the last few years the interest towards online trading activities increased with a trend of over +192% yearly and the number of new users approaching this world is constantly climbing to new records: Keywords like \"crypto trading\", \"bitcoin\", \"decentralized finance\", etc have been growing exponentially based on the trends research on Google Trend. The increasing number of users entering the crypto world is a clear fact.\r\nBased on public company numbers, all the top exchange platforms like Binance and Coinbase have seen an enormous escalation on their volumes and user base. Just the whole market of the crypto world itself has now acquired a capitalization bigger than gold or other storical assets. In this fast growing scenario, the user base of people adopting online trading or investment solutions is going to explode in the current decade.\r\n \r\nThe social media\r\nUsers on Crokt will be able to freely share their ideas and thoughts about everything inside the crypto\u2019s world like newly launched cryptocurrencies, NFTs, De-fi projects, Farming or Staking, and so on.\r\nThis will let newbies learn about their favourite crypto and keep pros updated with detailed analysis at the same time.\r\nPeople can share everything related to the crypto world, Like, comment, repost and chat with other people safely thanks to the end-to-end encryption system.\r\nChats section\r\nCrokt users can create and join private chats, groups and channels for public and private announces.\r\nEverybody can choose the best way to create and share informations and opinions about their favorite assets and interests, directly on the App!
