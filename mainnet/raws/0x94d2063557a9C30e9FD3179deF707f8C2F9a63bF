You send N eth (max 2 eth, we don't want whales monopolizing)\\n//  2. Other people send\\n//  3. Once N * 2 eth accrues in the contract, you get N *2 eth back, minus a 10% dev fee\\n//\\n//  Note: it's first-come-first-serve. This means every contribution is added to a queue\\n//  and the payouts are done by processing the queue, in order. You know...like a literal ponzi :)\\n//\\n//  FAQ:\\n//  1. Q: Where to trade? A: nowhere, this is not a token, you simply send eth to this contract address.\\n//  2. Q: Wen lock? A: this is not a token, no liquidity, no lock needed.\\n//  3. Q: Wen renounce? A: Maybe never, to be able to change the max contribution amount if needed. However, the owner can't do anything else so it's safu.\\n//  4. Q: Wen socials? A: create them and I'll join ;) Otherwise send a message (0tx plus text) to the dev wallet 0x615A2a9CDa24F20b79e3d9077068AE2C2A7D7f04\\n//  5. Q: Can I send more than once? A: Yes, but EACH contribution is entered in the queue, so if you contribute multiple times you get rewarded when the turn of each contribution comes.\\n//  6. Q: What if people stop sending? A: Then the ponzi dies, so ya better shill ya know? :) Note that any eth left in the contract will stay there forever, me (the dev) can't retrieve it (so I can't rug)\\n//  7. Q: There's more eth in the contract than N * 2 my contribution, why am I not getting paid out? A: Order...you need to wait your turn. Also, only 5 contributions are paid out at a time (for gas optimization), just wait until someone else contributes again.\\n\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract LP is Ownable {\\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\\n    uint256 maxContribution = 2 ether;\\n\\n    struct Contributor {\\n        address addr;\\n        uint amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    Contributor[] contributors;\\n    uint currentPayoutIndex = 0;\\n    address devWallet = 0x615A2a9CDa24F20b79e3d9077068AE2C2A7D7f04;\\n\\n    constructor () {\\n    }\\n\\n    function setMaxContribution(uint256 newMax) external onlyOwner() {\\n        maxContribution = newMax;\\n    }\\n\\n    receive() external payable {\\n        require(msg.value <= maxContribution);\\n\\n        contributors.push(Contributor(msg.sender, msg.value));\\n\\n        for (uint i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\\n            uint256 balance = address(this).balance;\\n            Contributor storage currentContributor = contributors[currentPayoutIndex];\\n            uint256 payoutAmount = currentContributor.amount.mul(2);\\n\\n            if (balance > payoutAmount) {\\n                uint256 tax = payoutAmount.mul(10).div(100);\\n                uint256 payout = payoutAmount - tax;\\n\\n                payable(devWallet).transfer(tax);\\n                payable(currentContributor.addr).transfer(payout);\\n\\n                currentPayoutIndex++;\\n            } else {\\n                break;\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"remappings\": [],\r\n    \"optimizer\": {\r\n      \"enabled\": false,\r\n      \"runs\": 200\r\n    },\r\n    \"evmVersion\": \"istanbul\",\r\n    \"libraries\": {},\r\n    \"outputSelection\": {\r\n      \"*\": {\r\n        \"*\": [\r\n          \"evm.bytecode\",\r\n          \"evm.deployedBytecode\",\r\n          \"devdoc\",\r\n          \"userdoc\",\r\n          \"metadata\",\r\n          \"abi\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}}", "ABI": "[{\"inputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"constructor\"},{\"anonymous\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"indexed\":true,\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"previousOwner\",\"type\":\"address\"},{\"indexed\":true,\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"newOwner\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"OwnershipTransferred\",\"type\":\"event\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"owner\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"renounceOwnership\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"newMax\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"setMaxContribution\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"newOwner\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"transferOwnership\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"stateMutability\":\"payable\",\"type\":\"receive\"}]", "ContractName": "LP", "CompilerVersion": "v0.8.0+commit.c7dfd78e", "OptimizationUsed": "0", "Runs": "200", "ConstructorArguments": "", "EVMVersion": "Default", "Library": "", "LicenseType": "", "Proxy": "0", "Implementation": "", "SwarmSource": ""}]}
