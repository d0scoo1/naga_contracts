But wait, what is a digital asset?\r\nWhat is a digital asset?\r\n\u201cDigital\u201d simply means in the form of data. \u201cAsset\u201d is a resource that has economic value. Hence, \u201cDigital Asset\u201d is anything constructed by data and perceived as having economic value.\r\nIn the age of Web 2.0, information and content are generated and broadcasted all across the internet. Anyone can have access to it. Anyone can download a nice photograph and use it in other sites. There is an abundance of online resources ready to be copied, pasted and re-created.\r\nFor most online resources, no one has the exclusive right of data and content. Because it is not exclusive, it lacks economic value.\r\nHowever, if an online resource is made exclusive to one\u2019s ownership, possessable and non-duplicable, then it can have economic value. This concept gives birth to the first universal digital asset \u2014 Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nWhat about Bitcoin?\r\nBitcoin, the digital money that can be transferred on the internet, has introduced and successfully proven the concept of exclusivity for digital data. But you may ask, what is so special about it? There are already Paypal, Venmo, Visa, Alipay, all serving the same function \u2014 online transaction of money.\r\nBefore we delve into the differences, one needs to understand the role of companies like Venmo. Remember that anyone can copy and paste digital data? Someone who is computer savvy can just cheat by copying and pasting more digital money. It is therefore up to PayPal (and banks) serving as an intermediary to prevent that. They do so by acknowledging your transaction, reconciling everyone\u2019s account balance, and maintaining the authenticity of the money ledger.\r\nNow, there are two notable differences between Bitcoin and traditional digital money. Firstly, these companies are intermediaries \u2014 they know everything about your identity and transaction details. They can even stop your transaction if they want to. Secondly, most transactions are either limited by national borders, or otherwise charging hefty transaction fees and long overdue.\r\nEnters Bitcoin \u2014 a non-sovereign digital currency that is not controlled by any company, institution, and government.\r\nUsing Bitcoin, there is no intermediary that automatically collects your identity and transaction data. Probably not everyone cares about this anyway. The real advantage is you can send Bitcoin to someone on the other side of the world instantly and cheaply.\r\nBitcoin: ~10 min + $1\u20132 USD per transaction (average fee in July 2019)\r\nvs\r\nBank: ~2+ day settlement + 2\u20133% fee\r\nHow does Bitcoin achieve such superiority?\r\nAccording to the above metrics, you may wonder, how does Bitcoin achieve such superiority?\r\nThis is another complex topic. Long story short, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to avoid having any human intermediary to maintain the ledger. With the underlying blockchain, no one can copy and paste Bitcoin. I can send you Bitcoin directly without going through PayPal or banks.\r\nAlthough the functionality of Bitcoin sounds fantastic, there are still technical hurdles to overcome, such as the scalability limitation. The current Bitcoin network limits the maximum amount of transactions it can verify within a given amount of time. Despite the transfer process is still faster than traditional banking, it is still slower than Paypal or Visa.\r\nNonetheless, many talents are researching and developing solutions to overcome this scalability hurdle. A promising solution is Lightning Network \u2014 a second layer technology for bitcoin that uses micropayment channels to scale Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s capability to conduct transactions.\r\nBitcoin makes life easier. Yet, it is just one example of digital assets. Other types of digital assets are emerging and slowly permeating into our everyday use cases, such as different cryptocurrencies and security tokens. We will cover the potential of Bitcoin and other digital asset use cases in future blogs, so stay tuned!\r\n\r\n\r\nLaunching Aisle \u2014 The Premier Mock Crypto Trading App\r\n\r\n\r\nMass adoption is a phrase everyone hears a lot within the crypto industry. To reach mass adoption, the industry will need to work together to build a positive narrative around this emerging asset class, especially amongst the young generation who will be the future users of digital tokens.\r\nTo increase awareness among youngsters like ourselves, we have built Aisle \u2014 a life-like mock crypto trading mobile app for people looking to gain cryptocurrency experience.\r\n\r\nAvailable for download on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=leafyfied.aisle.finance\r\n\r\nSign-up for iOS Beta: https://www.aislefinance.com/\r\n\r\nThe app serves as a safe way to practice trading and investing with real-time market simulation, providing a realistic and risk-free environment for people to accelerate their crypto learning curve at zero costs.\r\nWhile building the Aisle app, we want to deliver the message to our users (especially people new to the space) that cryptocurrency is not as scary as it sounds. For example, Bitcoin is not that expensive to buy \u2014 you don\u2019t need $60,000 USD to buy a bitcoin because it is divisible.\r\nWe emphasize heavily on user interface and user experience of the mobile app. After all, we are building a simple, intuitive, and clean user interface that defines our state-of-the-art mobile platform.\r\n\r\nTo start off, users will receive $50,000 mock USD in their portfolios. Users can place buy and sell orders just like on an actual exchange. To mirror as close to real-life trading experience, users will be able to place both market order and limit order, each with different commission rates.\r\nA distinguishing important element of Aisle is zero latency to real-time market prices. This is to make sure our users experience instant market movements for each token so that they can test trading strategies live. The app also provides a list of order history that shows a comprehensive record of user trading activities.\r\n\r\nDuring this first launch, we are working closely with our first batch of users to collect feedback and continuously enhance Aisle\u2019s user experience.\r\nTo our users: Have fun! Challenge yourself to achieve more and improve your skills with our easy-to-use features. Through participating in this lifelike simulated experience, we hope Aisle can boost your confidence with crypto trading and investing. Welcome to the digital token economy!\r\nAisle is a start-up based in the USC Incubator, co-founded by a few core members of the Blockchain@USC community.\r\n\r\nGiving power back to people?\r\n\r\nMany people have heard about Bitcoin; few people comprehend its deeper implications.\r\nSome people understand the concept of blockchain; fewer of them recognize their use cases and potential.\r\nWhat confuses people even more: how is blockchain related to cryptocurrencies? Why do some use cases require tokens (aka cryptocurrencies) while others do not?\r\nAnd most of all, why should people care?\r\nThe interesting fact is that many people already do care. A variety of individuals and associations, from corporations to startups to governments to students, are already taking advantage of this new technology.\r\nFacebook announced a proposal to launch its own cryptocurrency Libra onto the world\u2019s largest social network. China and Venezuela, two very different countries, both declared plans to issue national cryptocurrencies. The SEC is pushing to make digital assets such as Bitcoin taxable. Even JP Morgan is launching the JPM Coin in spite of CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s openly professed dislike for Bitcoin.\r\nWhat is the rationale behind so many powerful actors of the global economy getting involved with cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech?\r\nThere are 2 main benefits: 1) cost reduction and 2) value reallocation.\r\nCost reduction refers to the trimming of unnecessary business processes allowed by blockchain, thus cutting costs. Enterprises in the supply-chain and financial industry are implementing a semi-public blockchain, or \u201cconsortium blockchain\u201d, to simplify and automate business processes for cost reduction.\r\nValue reallocation, on the other hand, is what makes everyone want to have skin in the game. You may have already noticed the pattern already: different stakeholders (such as China, Facebook, and JP Morgan) are all trying to issue their version of a cryptocurrency. Think deeper, it makes sense. In theory, if value can be reallocated by new digital tokens, then whoever is behind the tokens will capture a large part of the value.\r\nEconomic value is quantified by money since it is a liquid medium of exchange. The money we use today consists of government-backed fiat currencies such as USD and RMB. However, serious problems exist with the current monetary system, which is largely controlled by governments and central banks.\r\nSo, what is wrong with the current monetary system?\r\nTo sum up, the world has become numb to the ever-inflating global economy. Too much money printing has consumed the future with debts.\r\nMoney printing refers to the non-stop quantitative easing programs the central banks have engaged in since the 2008 financial crisis. The problem is, this is merely a short term fix. The newly printed money does not effectively flow into the real consumer economy \u2014 clearly evidenced by the stagnated Consumer Price Index. It instead flows into financial assets \u2014 assets owned by the rich. So, the rich get richer, driving an even wider gap in wealth disparity. Meanwhile, the global economy is burdened with heavier debts.\r\n\r\nThis is part of why we see many geopolitical tensions in the developed world now, from Brexit to rising populist movements to Hong Kong\u2019s situation today. As for developing countries such as Venezuela and Zimbabwe, people\u2019s life savings are being depleted by hyperinflation due to poor government monetary policy. There is a global phenomenon of discontent with our current system.\r\nThese ongoing issues partly stem from the lack of an accountability system. Those who control our money do not make accountable and transparent decisions. Former regulator CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo sums it well:\r\n\u201cAt the heart of the financial crisis, perhaps the most critical element was the lack of visibility into the counterparty credit exposure of one major financial institution to another. Probably the most glaring omission that needed to be addressed was that lack of visibility, and here we are in 2016 and we still don\u2019t have it.\u201d\r\nSo there you have it, the current monetary system is problematic for value allocation. If you watched the Joker movie, you can probably grasp the picture even better.\r\nSo, what\u2019s next?\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function totalSupply()
