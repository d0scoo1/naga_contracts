TUBATA is the default currency of the platform and serves three main use cases:\r\nPlatform Currency\r\nTUBATA is the default currency for the Tube Bata platform. Users can use TUBATA to pay for transaction fees and also to purchase option products. Transaction fees will be collected into a reserve fund, and the use of this fund will be decided upon via decentralized governance.\r\nUser Incentives\r\nTo encourage users to deposit assets and incentivize a positive feedback loop, there will be token incentives paid out in TUBATA. It is important for the platform to have initial liquidity to enable the option products to have accurate pricing and optimum profitability.\r\nGovernance\r\nTUBATA will function as a governance token for the Tube Bata platform. TUBATA holders will collectively propose and vote on which assets to support, which protocols to integrate, fee ratios, use of reserve funds, and more.\r\n\r\nMeet the Core Team:\r\n\r\nSerge Levin \u2014 https://www.linkedin.com/in/serge-l-00590b168\r\nKent Osband \u2014 https://www.linkedin.com/in/kent-osband-ba549b13\r\nEvelina Lavrova \u2014 https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelina-lavrova-58186438\r\nRoadmap\r\n\r\nLets go!\r\nWe hope you have come away from this article with a clear understanding of what Tube Bata Finance is bringing to the market, what you can do with it, the function of the TUBATA token, and who the people are behind the project. We are excited to bring our vision into the world and welcome you to join us!\r\n\r\n\r\nTube Bata Finance Partners with Bella Protocol to Bring Complex DeFi Financial Products to Users\r\n\r\nWe are excited to announce that Tube Bata Finance has entered a strategic partnership with Bella Protocol, a suite of open finance products that aims to bring mass adoption to DeFi asset management. Tube Bata Finance is going to offer innovative products such as Double No-Touch Options and Volatility Income Pools for traders to exploit crypto volatility with simplified user experience.\r\nTube Bata Finance packages interest rate products together with derivatives to offer a wide variety of financial products for users to choose from based on their preferences and goals.\r\nThe vision of Tube Bata Finance matches with Bella Protocol\u2019s. Bella Flex Savings v2 facilitates one-click yield farming with auto-compounding and gas fee saver. Currently Bella\u2019s core team is building tools to enable easy access to global liquidity and premier financial service for anyone, anywhere. With this partnership with Tube Bata Finance, we are one step closer to bringing this vision to reality.\r\nBella Protocol has been a strategic investor since the early stage of Tube Bata Finance. Both parties are exploring ways to integrate and create complex financial products on DEXes across blockchains and emerging DeFi derivatives markets.\r\nAbout Bella Protocol\r\nBella Protocol is a suite of open finance products that aims to bring mass adoption to DeFi asset management. Bella\u2019s first yield product, Flex Savings v2 is live on Ethereum with $40 million TVL.\r\nBella Protocol is backed by Binance Labs and Arrington XRP Capital and several other renowned investors. BEL token is supported on Binance, Bithumb and other major exchanges.\r\nBella\u2019s core team consists of serial entrepreneurs and blockchain veterans who have tremendous experience and a proven track record in finance, cryptography, blockchain, and engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAME BATA becomes MaticVerse!\r\nGAME BATA has grown up and become MaticVerse! We as a team, and as a token have evolved, and want to achieve bigger and better things.\r\nThe GAME BATA chapter\r\nWe started GAME BATA as we saw the positives tokens Babycake and BabyXRP brought to their holders, and we wanted to provide a similar service but rewarding our holders with one of the most sought-after tokens in the cryptoverse, Matic. As big believers in Matic as a layer 2 solution, we thought we could spread our enthusiasm through GAME BATA. Mission accomplished.\r\nAs GAME BATA we managed to provide our holders with over 600,000+ Matic tokens which today is the equivalent of over $1million! We also achieved a market cap of $8million at our highest, meaning an 80x for our early investors! We did all this while being listed on ApeSwap. We had to educate thousands of people about ApeSwap as a DEX platform and brought them a huge surge of volume. We also established a collaboration with Polygon themselves! No other \u2018meme coin\u2019 has ever established a collaboration with a top 10 token and we are immensely proud to have made history and become the first one. In just our first 5 days we were responsible for their unique holder wallets to increase by 600%!\r\nWhy the evolution?\r\nThe evolution to MaticVerse, we believed was essential to not fall into the category of being just another meme coin. As a team of experienced individuals within the crypto space, we know we can build something much greater than that, leaving a much bigger impression! However, we will continue to stay true to our original values and provide our holders with Matic reflections.\r\nWhat direction does the MaticVerse story go in now?\r\nFirstly, our amazing devs have figured out a way of us being able to list on UniSwap, whilst still being able to provide our holders with Matic rewards. UniSwap is THE biggest DEX on BSC and will give us access to a much larger audience, furthermore, it will bring the investors who were apprehensive about using Apeswap, to us. It will also solve several problems such as correct price listing and charts on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, live Poocoin trading and live Dextools trading and trending. Another great advantage to relaunching is that it will allow us to build a bridge between the Matic side and the BSC side as we will have the right number of tokens. Our community were huge advocates for this feature, and we always take into consideration their feedback.\r\nOur aim when creating a token was always to provide a long-term solution to the problems, we saw in the BSC space. Our answer to creating longevity to the project was to add utility. What more fun utility is there than art and gaming?!\r\nOur NFT\u2019s and Game plan\r\nOur NFT\u2019s and game will be intertwined with one another, with the NFT\u2019s being the characters from our game. Our first game phase will be a PvE battle game following the story of our characters, The Baby Vengers. Using our 18 unique superheroes, we will have a variety of traits and rarities you can discover by minting them from our NFT crystals. Using these characters, you can level up by defeating villains, earn MaticVerse rewards as you progress, all the while indulging in the immersive gameplay we have to offer.\r\nGame phase 2 will be the introduction of new PvP battle modes where users can battle against each other, and the release of our game as a mobile app on iOS and Android. Releasing on mobile gaming platforms will allow us to tap into a multibillion-dollar market, giving us a stage for limitless growth!\r\nFinally, Game phase 3 will be releasing the game on all console platforms and PC. But most importantly, adding the RPG free-roaming game mode. It will create an incredible experience for our users to roam through the Baby Venger multi-verse, with dynamic quests and levels to explore.\r\nWe are excited to reveal more as we get closer to the launch of the game, and we can\u2019t wait to share our products and vision with the World!\r\nMaticVerse is about to go intergalactic! Book your window seat on our spaceship and enjoy the ride!\r\nLaunch Dates\r\nWe will be relaunching on UniSwap on Monday 23th September and Sushiswap on Monday 20th September.\r\n*/\r\n\r\npragma
