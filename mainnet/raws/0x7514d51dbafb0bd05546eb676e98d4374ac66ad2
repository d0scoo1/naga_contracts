This simply means one wallet address per participation into the presale is being tracked for ether refund. Multiple addresses will require multiple FLIGHT SWAP purchases for qualification of multiple gas refunds.\r\n\r\nCan I transfer anything and Get Refunded?\r\nThe DAPP only supports erc20 tokens.\r\n\r\nIs there limit to the gas I can be refunded?\r\nYou can get as many as your gas spent back, as long as you have the required amount of FLIGHT SWAP to cover that. Simply put 1 ETH = 1 FLIGHT SWAP, so if you have spent 10 ETH on gas fees and wishes to reclaim all, you will need to purchase 10 FLIGHT SWAP.\r\n\r\nCan I transfer my FLIGHT SWAP after purchasing during sale stage?\r\nThe token will not be transferable before presale ends.\r\n\r\nWhen will FLIGHT SWAP be tradable after sale stage?\r\nFLIGHT SWAP will be tradable on uniswap automatically at end of presale with 60% of tokens at 1:1\r\n\r\nHow much Time do I Have to Reclaim My Fees?\r\nReclaims will last 25 Days. 5 days of the presale and 20 Days after presale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor My Subsequent transactions, how do I Get Back Gas Fess?\r\nTo get back gas fees on your subsequent exchanges or transactions, you have to use Flight Swap freeswapdApp. For instance; If you trade any erc20 listed on uniswap through our dApp, you will get back your excess gas fee refunded.\r\n\r\nIs FLIGHT SWAP pegged to ETH?\r\nNo, Flight Swap is not pegged to anything, rather the mechanism behind it is dependent on the market price and the price of the reclaimed ether. So the reclaim price will always float and will ensure Flight Swap freeswap user to bring the price towards it.\r\n\r\nHow You Control Inflation?\r\nThere is a minimum amount of FLIGHT SWAP required in order to mint new FLIGHT SWAP as fees, this controls minting. FLIGHT SWAP is valued as ETH, so there can never be more FLIGHT SWAP than ETH in circulation, in order words, inflation against ETH base is very low.\r\n\r\nCan I Get Refund On My Subsequent Transactions?\r\nYes, if you perform you transactions through the Flight Swap freeswapdApp\r\n\r\nBecome A Flight Swap Affiliate\r\n\r\nIntroduce Flight Swap and FLS to the world, and let them know the new way of spending absolute nothing when trading on Dexes.\r\n\r\nHow It Works\r\nEarn unlimited commission by joining our affiliate program and promoting Flight Swap\r\n\r\n\r\nBecome an affiliate\r\n\r\nClick on \u201cConnect Dapp\u201d to get started and have access to all Flight Swap features and able to track your referral activities.\r\n\r\nPromote Flight Swap\r\nClick on \u201cLoan Referral\u201d to access our affiliate page as well as copy your referral link at the top and share to your link.\r\n\r\nEarn unlimited commission\r\nEvery time a customer who joins through your link harvests rewards, 5% of what he harvest is automatically credited directly into your wallet.\r\n\r\nEarn With Flight Swap\r\nWhen you refer a new user who stakes/adds liquidity to the pool or reclaims gas fees, you earn 5% of whatever they harvest and 10% of whatever they reclaim as gas fees.\r\nInstantly connect your wallet and start using our affiliate features.\r\n\r\nNo action required as commissions and rewards are directly sent to your wallet\r\n\r\nRefer an unlimited number of users or customers to Flight Swap.\r\n\r\nTrack your referral activities and performance through filtering and view transactions on explorers.\r\n\r\nGet compensated in FLS for each commission when your downlines harvest their rewards\r\n\r\nNo earning limitations for both LP farming/loan and reclaim.

In mathematics, the truth is somewhere out there in a place no one knows, beyond all the beaten paths. And it\u2019s not always at the top of the mountain. It might be in a crack on the smoothest cliff or somewhere deep in the valley.\u201d\r\nSince the creation of ethereum, blockchain technology has seen massive growth and has metamorphosed into greater heights. Different applications have evolved and many more are yet to be conceived and launched.\r\nBut one thing that has gradually become a nightmare is the gas fee. This has delayed the take-off of so many projects experience, and end-users are not able to partake in their beloved and perceived good projects due to high gas costs.\r\nIntroducing FlightSwap\r\nFlightSwap is a new cutting-edge decentralized fee reclaim and fee-less exchange for swapping erc20 tokens. FlightSwap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model to determine excess gas fees spent on each transaction carried out within the ecosystem and refund this excess or high gas fee spent on the network back to the user.\r\nBuilt on the ethereum network, FlightSwap refunds fees on erc20 transfers and will integrate other gas-consuming decentralized applications.\r\nSome key components and dApps on the ecosystem includes:\r\n>Swapping from one token to another\r\n>Reclaim dApp\r\n>Token transfers\r\n>Staking FLS. Must stake a minimum of 1 FLS required to be able to get a gas refund.\r\nOn FlightSwap, current and working integrations are both uniswap layer and sushiswap layer proxy contract, which is where paid fees are determined and refunded, with more proxy contracts for various applications on the way.\r\nYou swap from ETH => USDT, FlightSwap determine the extra gas fees spent and send them back to your wallet, and this is done in the same transaction as long as it passes through FlightSwap. Since FLS is an erc20, it is mined by sending transactions via our proxy. So the fees that get reclaimed are basically mined. This simply means the amount of FLS in circulation grows by the number of transactions routed.\r\nThe FLS Token\r\nOur Mission is to offer a solution to the current high gas fee on the ethereum ecosystem, give everyone an opportunity to participate in this emerging and fast-growing technology, and boost incentives for using the Ethereum network.\r\nToken utility\r\nFLS Token powers the FlightSwap ecosystem and is been utilized in the following ways\r\n\u2043Ether gas reclaim requires holding FLS token\r\n\u2043Spend FLS on our premium products and services.\r\n\u2043Stake FLS to receive rewards and freemium services and features.\r\n\u2043Holding FLS gives you the ability to instantly get back your excess ether spent on gas on that particular transaction.\r\nToken Name: FLS\r\nContract:\r\nCirculating Supply: Circulating supply of FLS Depends on total reclaimed ether and excess gas spent on swaps on our DEX.\r\nToken Price: For the initial phase purchase, the token price is set at 1 ETH = 1 FLS\r\nToken Type: ERC20\r\n\r\nStaking Programme: Your purchased FLS automatically becomes staked, which gives you the ability to get back your excess ether spent on the gas fees.\r\n\r\nTeam Tokens: To show our commitment, team allocation is vested for 2 years and deferred for 2 months.\r\nOUR ROADMAP\r\nFLIGHTSWAP OFFICIAL TOKEN SALE\r\nSale price is 1 ETH = 1 FLS\r\nTotal FLS for presale = No. of ETH deposited\r\nPurchase Min = No Min;\r\nMax = 10 FLS per address\r\nGas Reclaim Incentive is 100% per gas equivalent purchase during the presale\r\nThe referral incentive is 10% of your downline reclaim amount.\r\n**Note: this 1:1 ratio reclaim incentive will only be available during the sale phase and will change immediately after the presale\r\n* Gas reclaim incentive is the total amount of ether you can reclaim for participating in the sale phase (for instance, if you purchase 1 FLS during the presale, you will be able to get up to 100% of the total ether you have spent so far on the ethereum network. Depending on your entry time.\r\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\r\nQ1. What is FLS?\r\nAns. FLS is a token that represents all the fees you have paid and are paying to the ethereum network.\r\nQ2. What If I Have More than One Wallet Address?\r\nAns. If you have more than one wallet address and you wish to recover all the gas spent on them, you have to use each of them to purchase into the presale for them to qualify for a refund. This simply means one wallet address per participation into the presale is being tracked for ether refund. Multiple addresses will require multiple FLS purchases for the qualification of multiple gas refunds.\r\nQ3. Can I transfer anything and Get Refunded?\r\nAns. The DAPP only supports erc20 tokens.\r\nQ4. Is there a limit to the gas I can be refunded?\r\nAns. You can get as many as your gas spent back, as long as you have the required amount of FLS to cover that. Simply put 1 ETH = 1 FLS, so if you have spent 10 ETH on gas fees and wish to reclaim all, you will need to purchase 10 FLS.\r\nQ5. Can I transfer my FLS after purchasing during the sale stage?\r\nAns. The token will not be transferable before the presale ends.\r\nQ6. When will FLS be tradable after sale stage?\r\nAns. FLS will be tradable on uniswap automatically at end of presale with 60% of tokens at 1:1\r\nQ7. How much Time do I Have to Reclaim My Fees?\r\nAns. Reclaims will last 25 Days. 5 days of the presale and 20 Days after the presale.\r\nQ8. For My Subsequent transactions, how do I Get Back Gas Fess?\r\nAns. To get back gas fees on your subsequent exchanges or transactions, you have to use FlightSwapdApp. For instance; If you trade any erc20 listed on uniswap through our dApp, you will get back your excess gas fee refunded.\r\nQ9. Is FLS pegged to ETH?\r\nAns. No, FLS is not pegged to anything, rather the mechanism behind it is dependent on the market price and the price of the reclaimed ether. So the reclaim price will always float and will ensure FlightSwap users bring the price towards it.\r\nQ10. How You Control Inflation?\r\nThere is a minimum amount of FLS required in order to mint new FLS as fees, this controls minting. FLS is valued as ETH, so there can never be more FLS than ETH in circulation, in order words, inflation against ETH base is very low.\r\nQ11. Can I Get a Refund On My Subsequent Transactions?\r\nAns. Yes, if you perform your transactions through the FlightSwapdApp\r\n\r\n\r\nFlightSwap Governance\r\nINTRODUCING FLS GOVERNANCE\r\nAs a community-driven ecosystem, FlightSwap is powered by its governance token FLS, shaping and determining how the protocol operates.\r\nThe FLS token is utilized to the max in making sure for the smooth running and operation of the project and all related dApps and features that get integrated into it.\r\nWith unique features utilizing the FLS within the governance protocol includes;\r\nProxy Governance\r\nVoter Registry\r\nLoan\r\nLP Farming\r\nThe community can now confidently decide what happens and gets implemented within the protocol through voting \r\nThe Governance Overview\r\nThe FlightSwap utilizes a proxy contract for the governance as regards voters registry and proxy proposals.\r\nHow The FLS Governance Works\r\nThe governance begins with submitting or creating a proxy proposal, registering a vote, and executing a vote on proxy contracts.\r\nProxy Proposal\r\nAnyone can submit a proposal for a proxy contract (project) to be integrated.\r\nTo propose, you need to burn 100 FLS, this will get you 10,000 delegation required.\r\nTo do this, simply follow this procedure;\r\n1. Click on the Voter Registry dApp and select \u201cpermanent registration\u201d\r\n2. Enter the amount of FLS required to get 10,000 delegation votes, in this case, 100 FLS (i.e make sure you have up to 100 FLS required)\r\n3. Execute the registry action and approve the contract.\r\n4. After a successful notification, go to proxy Governance dApp and click on submit a proxy.\r\n5. Provide all necessary information needed for the proposal and click the submit button.\r\n\r\nFLS governance illustration\r\nIn summary, 100 FLS will need to be burned to submit a proposal and10,000 FLS votes delegated by the community.\r\n1% of the total supply is needed to win the vote. So for a user to be a proposer, he must have 10,000 FLS votes delegated to him and has to burn 100 FLS. Then voting starts.\r\nAs a proposer, you can delegate your votes to others, so their vote is counted as yours when they vote.\r\nVoter Registry\r\nTo have a vote in the registry, a user has two choices\r\n1. Burn 1 FLS\r\n2. Lock 1 FLS\r\nWhen you burn 1 FLS, you get 3 votes. 2 FLS, 6 votes, and so on.\r\nThe votes that have been generated as a result of burnt FLS cannot be converted back to FLS. But you will get to enjoy unlimited gasless transactions on the FlightSwap\r\nWhen you lock 1 FLS you get 1 vote. These votes can be converted back to FLS.\r\nThe ether fees refunds are issued to all valid voters, regardless if they have a FLS balance or not.\r\nExchanges, loans, and borrowing, LP farming can ask their users to delegate their votes to them to enable them to implement FLS proxy.\r\nUsers still control the votes and the locked FLS\r\nSo proxy proper needs 10,000 votes to submit and 1000 votes for a quorum.\r\nThe Governance Mechanism\r\nThis is how the governance will work, using the Uniswap V3 instance. assuming a user wants to add uniswap v3. After passing the proposal and approval stage, we create a proxy contract for uniswap3 and deploy it to mainnet.\r\nThe proxy contract will need to have the mint permission (granted in the FLS token contract ) to refund users' fees. This permission can only be granted by the governance contract after a vote on the proposal\r\nthe proxy address is submitted as a proposal, requesting minting permission\r\nusers vote if they want the proposal to be adopted\r\nif the users in favor of \u2014 votes \u2014 reach a quorum of 1% of the total supply, the proposal can be executed\r\nand the uniswap v3 proxy is granted mintPermission by the Governor Alpha contract\r\nThe Governor Alpha will have all the admin powers of the token\r\nit is also responsible for voting and Proxy Proposals.\r\nThen the public can now trade/swap all tradeable tokens on uniswap v3 through FlightSwap dApp. See the below illustration.\r\n*/\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function totalSupply() external view
