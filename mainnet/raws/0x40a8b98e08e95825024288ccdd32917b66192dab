And without any involvement from Tlon.\\n * How do I vote a galaxy?\\n Buy up enough WGLX to withdraw the top galaxy, vote it, and hold it till the\\n poll expires. Then you may redeposit it and get your WGLX back.\\n * How do I know the top galaxy will be allowed to vote in a poll?\\n The treasury forbids depositing a galaxy which has voted on any active poll.\\n * What if several people want to pool their fractions of WGLX to vote together?\\n They can use a straightforward contract to do this.\\n * What if there is only 1 galaxy in the treasury?\\n Actually withdrawing the bottom galaxy in the stack may be impossible due to\\n outstanding WGLX being lost, burned, or just incommunicado. Thus, if there is\\n exactly 1 galaxy deposited and you have more than half the outstanding WGLX, you\\n can vote/manage it through the contract without withdrawing it.\\n * Why would anyone be the first to deposit a galaxy?\\n As a motivator to get liquidity off the ground, there is a bonus for the first\\n few galaxy depositors. The 1st galaxy deposited earns 1,200,000 WGLX (and costs the\\n same to withdraw). The 2nd galaxy is 1,100,000 WGLX and the third is 1,050,000.\\n After that, subsquent galaxies are worth 1,000,000 WGLX each.\\n * How many galaxies can be deposited?\\n At most 128. If a majority of galaxies were deposited, the treasury would be\\n able to upgrade itself, which seems too dangerous.\\n * When can the contracts self-destruct?\\n Only when there are zero deposited galaxies and zero outstanding WGLX. The\\n contracts were directly deployed from an external account, so there is no\\n CREATE2 risk of hijacking the address with a different coin.\\n * What about censures and claims?\\n It is possible that the top galaxy you withdraw will have censures or claims\\n attached to it. Fortunately, nobody uses these for anything and they don't matter\\n at all.\\n * What about spawning?\\n You should only expect \\\"bare\\\" galaxies (which have already spawned all their\\n stars) to be deposited.\\n*/\\n\\n\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"./interface/IAzimuth.sol\\\";\\nimport
