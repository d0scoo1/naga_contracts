Incorporates UGC and Play to Earn to realize a metaverse space in a fantasy world.\r\nPlayers from various fields such as MMORPG developers, blockchain developers, and cryptocurrency finance experts from all over the world are developing the game as one team!\r\n* As the authorized source of \"META SOULS Online\", \"Elemental Knights Online\" is in Japan and is operated on Android, iPhone, Switch, and PlayStation4 platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project has three features: Free to Play x UGC to Earn x Play to Earn.\r\nAnyone can start the game for free, resell the items acquired in the game on the NFT Marketplace, buy the rights and sell costumes made by themselves.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating the concept of DeFi into the Metaverse space, we will realize an economic circle in a fantasy world that has never been experienced before.\r\n\r\nIn META WORLD of META SOULS Online, you can bring various NFTs into the game and play the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Limited fashion equipment\" with unique appearance and special abilities\r\n\r\nA limited number of rare and valuable \"special items\"\r\n\r\n\"Original equipment\" that has evolved uniquely by confronting strong enemies\r\nBy using these NFTs, you can form a party with your friends, defeat various monsters, get valuable items, play to earn, and interact with adventurers around the world and you can trade NFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated contents after release will include sales of NFTs related to the production rights of \"fashionable equipment\" and land NFTs related to the production rights of \"buildings, monsters and dungeons\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNFT regarding production rights for fashionable equipment\r\nThose who have this right can make their favorite fashionable equipment and register them in the game as NFT items.\r\nIt will be possible to make many products and build a brand to sell them.\r\nIn the future, manufacturers of various types such as corporate brands and animations will enter the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nNFT on land rights and production rights\r\nBy purchasing land, you can freely redesign the objects on the map, set your own NFTs as rare drop items for the monsters that appear there, and then release it to other players. You can also set up an entrance fee for the map and earn rights revenue from the map.\r\n\r\nPlay to Earn of META SOULS Online META WORLD\r\nIn this game, the in-game economy is composed of game money called ROND. ROND is like a Stable token and has the role of exchanging ROND earned in the game on the cryptocurrency exchange.\r\n\r\nROND is linked to the price of the cryptocurrency exchange, the value of ROND also changes even in the game, and arbitrage trading is adopted even in the in-game weapon shop.\r\n\r\nPlayers can earn income through NFT sales and ROND by accepting requests in the Metaverse world, adventuring dungeons with friends and defeating strong enemies to acquire valuable items in the game.\r\n\r\nSometimes you can earn unexpected income by acquiring rare items. It will be a great pleasure to achieve this with your friends.\r\n\r\nIn addition, all items in the Metaverse world have a fixed distribution quantity. If you get a rare item, the value will increase as the number of players increases and the demand increases.\r\n\r\nGeneral Situation\r\nCryptocurrencies are rising in popularity as blockchain technology continues to dominate the news. This is due to the fact that they are valued and can disrupt the banking and financial systems. NFT, on the other hand, has recently gotten a lot of attention and created a lot of buzzes. For example, the NFT industry has grown up to 700% till the December of 2021.\r\nGame NFT Industry\r\nThe video gaming industry (and the use of NFTs) has fast become one of the most important catalysts of broad blockchain adoption. Many gaming behemoths have realized this and are pouring a vast sum of money towards the creation of blockchain-based video games or features.\r\nBlockchain technology and its plethora of possibilities are set to infiltrate gamers\u2019 daily lives in the next few years. In total,  venture capitals have invested more than 1 billion USD in blockchain technology projects. But the most notable point among them is the NFT game, which has been reheated with the addition of the metaverse \"engine\".\r\nThis is why MetaSouls has found a way to combine the blockchain and NFT-based gaming worlds into a next-generation concept and create a universe of unique digital items.\r\nThe Way of MetaSouls\r\nThe future of blockchain video games will first come with Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). Specifically, these identifiable tokens are unique and can be used to represent virtual assets.\r\nMetaSouls makes blockchain technology accessible to ordinary consumers through these strategies:\r\nTokenization of digital items.\r\nThe concept of playing and learning to earn money.\r\nA friendly concept that is created based on consumers' passion for blockchain technology.\r\nAn open platform that welcomes users of different technical expertise.\r\nThe revenue-based model can be maintained with the MetaSouls value inflation limit.\r\nWe intend to transform the blockchain world in terms of technology by bringing digital collections, digital scarcity, and non-fungible tokens to practical application in the video games world. As a result, a growing number of typical customers are learning how distributed ledger technology works. People can observe how the blockchain industry is expanding and how it can be utilized outside of the banking sector. \r\nCheck out the legal agreement and terms & conditions section of this whitepaper for further information on legal terms.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nMetaSouls is a \u201cPLAY TO EARN\u201d game built on the ETHEREUM platform. In Business MetaSouls, players will embody cyborgs, go on an adventure to uncover the treasures, and learn more about mankind's once-famous civilizations.\r\nBusiness MetaSouls features basic yet appealing gameplay that is appropriate for all ages, and the game also demands players to think creatively in order to find a variety of priceless gems. These are the significant benefits that contribute to the game's unique appeal. Being enveloped in the rapid growth of Blockchain technology as well as the NFT coding trend, which is quickly entering the conventional gaming industry with a big number of Crypto believers. \r\nBusiness MetaSouls promises to make significant advancements in the project's development as well as the day-by-day completion of the full Ecosystem established by our developers.\r\nEthereum Blockchain technology (ETHEREUM/ERC20) is used to build the game's platform. In-game objects are encrypted in NFT format to allow for P2P peer-to-peer transactions and to support the Play to Earn (P2E) system.\r\n\r\nMission and Vision\r\n\r\nMission\r\nMetaSouls was created and developed for the purpose of making the blockchain platform which is accessible to everyone. The mission of MetaSouls is to create an integrated digital platform of tokenized resources that appeals to players by allowing them to join and gain benefits from Blockchain technology.\r\nVision\r\nWith the encryption of in-game objects using blockchain technology, the NFT game projects are truly revolutionizing the gaming industry today. This is why MetaSouls aims to create a new generation game idea that combines blockchain and NFT-based gaming world. For long-term vision, we are going to build a sustainable community where the players can develop their mindsets and skills comprehensively.\r\n\r\n\r\nProblems and Solutions\r\n\r\nProblems\r\nIn terms of providing a gaming experience, the NFT gaming sector is restricted. Instead of paying greater attention to user input, the manufacturers are mainly concerned with the in-game revenue methods. Furthermore, the game\u2019s path is unclear, causing players to feel bored during play.\r\nIt will be difficult for individuals unfamiliar with the NFT or blockchain space to keep track of token pricing. After the game debuted, the token price skyrocketed, and many newcomers abandoned the game due to a lack of funds to continue.\r\nFinally, doubts about token inflation and acts of vandalism in the game are raised by the potential risks of hacking and third-party software.\r\nSolutions\r\nFocusing on gameplay but still maintaining the easy points in game mode to keep up with the trend is our priority. Then users will be trained to play the game based on logic and skills to make money instead of \"click to earn\". Game visuals will be updated continuously to improve players' experience.\r\nThe game has a stable ROI mechanism to ensure fairness between early players and newbies.\r\nBlind spots and random selections will be created for the security system to restrict hackers from penetrating into the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGame Story\r\nBrief introduction about MetaSouls world\r\nSet in the year 3002, gold and gem resources become a hot trend after a man discovers a lump of gold in a riverbed by accident. As a result of this news, individuals all over the world hurried to investigate the underground in every part of the globe in the hope of finding a life-changing opportunity. The game's protagonists are sensitive to this tendency and begin their exploration. Traveling to five different lands which are not only famous for their riches and products, but also for their dangers. When mining on specific terrains, innovators' tools, and machinery can maximize efficiency. Joining in the competition to gather the most resources in the hopes of transforming people's lives in the future.\r\n*/\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function
