Putin already attacked Ukraine leading to thousands of deaths.\r\n * - The threat is imminent.

Thousands people (in both sides) already died.\r\n *   One could argue that heads of state are special and \"worth\" more than regular citizens, we do not share this point of view, but for those who do, Putin already tried to eliminate the president of Ukraine multiple times https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/volodymyr-zelensky-survives-three-assassination-attempts-in-one-week/ar-AAUBwac \r\n *   The bounty only targets the individual responsible.\r\n *   This individual is a military target: The Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander-in-Chief_of_the_Russian_Armed_Forces).\r\n *   The bounty is neutral about whether violence should be used or not (any mean to remove him from power would fullfill the bounty).\r\n *   The bounty provides a way out to Putin as it would be cancelled if he were to recall his troops.\r\n */\r\ncontract RemovePutinBounty {\r\n\r\n\r\n    /* Owner */\r\n    // The DAO or multisig which will report the events.\r\n    address public owner;\r\n\r\n    modifier isOwner() {\r\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Caller is not owner\");\r\n        _;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Set contract deployer as owner\r\n     */\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        owner = msg.sender; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev Change owner\r\n     * @param newOwner address of new owner\r\n     */\r\n    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public isOwner {\r\n        owner = newOwner;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* ERC20 */\r\n    // Contributors get a token representing their contribution.\r\n    // In case the bounty is cancelled (Putin recalls his troops or is removed from power during a ceasefire), those tokens can be redeemed for the ETH.\r\n    // In case the bounty is paid out.
