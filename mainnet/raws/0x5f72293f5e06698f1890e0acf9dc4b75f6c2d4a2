Blockchain also makes it impossible or difficult to hack, change, and cheat the system.\r\nBlockchain is majorly associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and it is a digital ledger technology that is commonly used to record and store transactions. Blockchain is also referred to as a digital ledger.\r\n\r\nBlockchain Transforming Manufacturing Industry\r\nThe demand for Blockchain in the manufacturing supply chain has been increased a lot and in other industries. Blockchain can create a revolution in all sectors. Some of the industries which have the immense benefits from it are \u2013\r\nBanking and finance\r\nHealthcare\r\nReal estate\r\nSecurity\r\nManufacturing industries\r\nRole of Blockchain in the manufacturing industry\r\nWhile talking about modern ways of manufacturing industries, the supply chain can run across several organizations. This makes the system difficult to find ways for increasing efficiency and for chasing events. But when it comes to Blockchain, it can help to make a secure and smarter supply chain moreover you can track the journey of the product. For instance, if you are looking for material delivery, you can easily track the material. Everything is recorded in Blockchain as a block.\r\nThere are several benefits of Blockchain technology, and here are some of the advantages which work in the real scenario-\r\nAmplify Inventory Management\r\nBlockchain provides permanent data for each transaction that takes place in the process of the supply chain. It also helps you to connect with the value chain, be it a production site, suppliers, and distribution centers. The records are easily accessible for those who are connected with the network. Everyone in the network has the information; therefore, no confusion occurs in the supply chain.\r\nUpgraded data security\r\nInformation such as contact details and invoices which are exchanged in the supply chain process is highly confidential. Sharing these details by the traditional methods can be highly risky can anyone can hack this information efficiently. Instead, blockchains use these traditional methods to keep the information more secure in cryptography techniques. You can choose the applications of Blockchain in manufacturing to avoid the cyber attack.\r\nBetter Transparency And Traceability\r\nBlockchain technology in manufacturing or supply chain can offer all the information related to the transaction. For example, how the products are manufactured, from where they are shipped, how data are managed, etc. if you have the permanent data, then it can be shared with the supply chain network easily. You only need to have the tracking tracing abilities.\r\nAutomatic Payment Process\r\nBlockchain in industrial automation helps in transferring the funds to any part of the world. Now you don\u2019t have to stick to the traditional methods of banking. Money transfers can be direct between the payee and payer. The payment system throughout the Blockchain technology is secured, and it can be done quickly. You don\u2019t have to wait for the payments.\r\nImproved Customer Engagement\r\nBlockchain is much stronger than typical technology. You can analyze the data to create predictions and forecasts that can help you solve issues in your supply chain management. Moreover, analytical tools can also help to boost customer satisfaction. Blockchain can be used to find ways to develop your delivery timelines. To a certain extent, customers can also access Blockchain data.\r\n\r\nBlockchain is suitable for every industry which has a high value, risk and is highly regulated. There are lists of benefits that help prevent tampering and counterfeiting the data, and it also offers preventive maintenance by identifying where, when, and how the failure occurs. Texuz can help you with this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTexuz Launches Real Estate Platform on Tezos blockchain\r\nToday, Texuz announced that it is building a real estate investment platform on the Tezos blockchain to issue and manage digital tokens representing real estate assets.\r\nThe new platform will give investors direct access to a cutting-edge asset class to add to their investment portfolios.

One of the best things about artificial intelligence is that it has machines or bots that may let you reap benefits like enhanced production, new opportunities, and reduced human effort.\r\nFrom the shortage of professionals to complexity in making business-oriented decisions and issues related to integration, AI has conquered many internal challenges.\r\nSo, without wasting time, let\u2019s discuss how AI is helping the manufacturing sector to grow to an unprecedented scale.\r\nAI: Future Of Manufacturing\r\n1. Directed Automation\r\nAI bots may easily manage multiple tasks, design the production model, build automation solutions, and eliminate human effort and error while delivering the best quality assurance.\r\n2. 24x7 Production\r\nWhile manpower can work for a limited period of time (8\u20139 hours), robots and machines can perform the same operation 24x7 and at a much faster rate.\r\n3. Safer Operational Environment\r\nIncorporating AI means fewer human resources are required to carry out extensive laborious tasks and without any hassle.\r\n4. Novel Opportunities for Humans\r\nAs AI can easily handle the manufacturing tasks, employees can now focus on other core operations of the business.\r\n5. Condensed Operating Costs\r\nAs intelligent machines start managing daily activities, businesses can enjoy considerably lower operating costs.\r\n6. Added Benefits of AI\r\nBots can easily gather and extract data, acknowledge patterns, learn and adapt to new things or environments through machine intelligence, learning, and speech recognition. Manufacturers can harness AI:\r\nMake quick business decisions\r\nEnhanced production outcomes\r\nAdvance process effectiveness\r\nReduce the cost of operation\r\nFacilitate superior scalability\r\nFacilitate product development\r\nThe Growth of Manufacturing Industry with Mushrooming AI\r\nThe continued enhancement in the manufacturing sector has been used for QA to detect product faults in real-time. While plant managers do not want to pay employees to enter information, AI with computer vision may help you to rationalize how information can be obtained.\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nArtificial intelligence could be an incredibly important solution in creating things, enhancing them, and making them cost-effective for business growth. But it couldn\u2019t be wrong to say that is no replacement for human ingenuity in dealing with the unexpected changes in tastes and demands \u2014 or in deciding what decision you can make.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is Blockchain Transforming the Real Estate Industry?\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnological developments have shaken up the current scenario, and one such innovation is none other than Blockchain. Gone are the days when real estate transactions are often conducted via conventional mediums, majorly involve face-to-face interactions across different entities. Blockchain, however, enables assets like real estate to be tokenized and be traded like cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s discuss the ways in which blockchain is transforming the real estate industry:\r\n1. Platforms and Marketplaces\r\nSince real estate technology introduced in the market, it was primarily concerned with buyers and sellers. With the introduction of blockchain, unconventional ways to trade real estate will enable trading platforms and online marketplaces to streamline transactions in an efficient manner.\r\nFor example, Aqar Chain has developed a platform that uses blockchain technology to facilitate real estate by providing investors with a quick way to invest without undergoing regulatory burdens. The platform facilitates a streamlined gateway for investors to participate in global real estate investments whilst benefiting from rising cryptocurrency markets.\r\n2. Liquidity\r\nSince real estate takes time for sales to conclude, it has long been considered an illiquid asset. With blockchain, cryptocurrencies and tokens can easily be traded through exchanges. And the best part is that seller doesn\u2019t have to wait for a buyer that can afford the whole property in order to get some value out of their property.\r\n3. Eliminate Intermediaries\r\nIt couldn\u2019t be wrong to say that banks and brokers have been a part of the real estate industry for decades. But with blockchain, there\u2019s likely to be a paradigm shift in real estate transactions. As some of the functions like listings, payments, and legal documentation can effortlessly be handled, this would eliminate intermediaries. And as a result, this will save significant upfront costs charged by these intermediaries. And not to forget the process will get hassle-free.\r\n4. Fractional Ownership\r\nBlockchain helps to eliminate the barriers to real estate investing. When it comes to acquiring property, investments need significant money. By allowing fractional ownership, investors can pool their money to acquire bigger ticket properties. With the help of blockchain, investors can easily access a trading app to buy and sell the token that perfectly caters to their needs and budget.\r\n5. Decentralization\r\nThere\u2019s no arguing with the fact that blockchain commands trust and security as a decentralized technology. The information is stored in the blockchain is accessible to all peers on the network, making data transparent. And when the information is verifiable to peers, buyers and sellers can easily conduct transactions. This would also help in eliminating fraud attempts to an unprecedented scale.\r\nConclusion\r\nGlobal real estate is currently dominated by corporate giants. With the adoption of blockchain, more and more people may access the market, making transactions secure and transparent. With blockchain-powered platforms like Texuz, inefficiencies of conventional real estate investing would be eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Top Habits of Wealthy Real Estate Entrepreneurs?\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you want to join the list of top real estate entrepreneurs? If so, this post is going to help achieve success without any difficulty.\r\nInvesting in real estate could be potentially daunting and risky. Investors, nowadays, earn profit by efficient property management, joint ventures, wholesaling, to name a few. To accomplish your goals, you need to be a little savvy to become successful.\r\nBut luckily, there are people who have shared their practices, views, and methods that may help an investor to get what they want.\r\n*/\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function totalSupply() external view returns(uint);\r\n\r\n    function balanceOf(address account) external view
