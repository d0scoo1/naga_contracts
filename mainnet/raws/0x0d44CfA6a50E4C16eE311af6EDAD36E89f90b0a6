Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the\\n * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() initializer {}\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initializer function from being invoked twice.\\n     */\\n    modifier initializer() {\\n        // If the contract is initializing we ignore whether _initialized is set in order to support multiple\\n        // inheritance patterns, but we only do this in the context of a constructor, because in other contexts the\\n        // contract may have been reentered.\\n        require(_initializing ? _isConstructor() : !_initialized, \\\"Initializable: contract is already initialized\\\");\\n\\n        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;\\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\\n            _initializing = true;\\n            _initialized = true;\\n        }\\n\\n        _;\\n\\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\\n            _initializing = false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initialization function so that it can only be invoked by functions with the\\n     * {initializer} modifier, directly or indirectly.\\n     */\\n    modifier onlyInitializing() {\\n        require(_initializing, \\\"Initializable: contract is not initializing\\\");\\n        _;\\n    }\\n\\n    function _isConstructor() private view returns (bool) {\\n        return !AddressUpgradeable.isContract(address(this));\\n    }\\n}\\n\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol\": {\r\n      \"content\": \"// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\\n// OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v4.5.0) (token/ERC20/ERC20.sol)\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./IERC20Upgradeable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"./extensions/IERC20MetadataUpgradeable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"../../utils/ContextUpgradeable.sol\\\";\\nimport \\\"../../proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\\\";\\n\\n/**\\n * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.\\n *\\n * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created.
