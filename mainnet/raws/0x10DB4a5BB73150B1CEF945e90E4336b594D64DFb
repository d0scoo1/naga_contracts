When some `redeemableERC20`\\n/// token holder calls `withdraw` they are sent the full balance they have not\\n/// previously claimed, multiplied by their fraction of the redeemable token\\n/// supply that they currently hold. As redeemable tokens are frozen after\\n/// distribution there are no issues with holders manipulating withdrawals by\\n/// transferring tokens to claim multiple times.\\n///\\n/// As redeemable tokens can be burned it is possible for the total supply to\\n/// decrease over time, which naively would result in claims being larger\\n/// retroactively (prorata increases beyond what can be paid).\\n///\\n/// For example:\\n/// - Alice and Bob hold 50 rTKN each, 100 total supply\\n/// - 100 TKN is deposited\\n/// - Alice withdraws 50% of 100 TKN => alice holds 50 TKN escrow holds 50 TKN\\n/// - Alice burns her 50 rTKN\\n/// - Bob attempts to withdraw his 50 rTKN which is now 100% of supply\\n/// - Escrow tries to pay 100% of 100 TKN deposited and fails as the escrow\\n///   only holds 50 TKN (alice + bob = 150%).\\n///\\n/// To avoid the escrow allowing more withdrawals than deposits we include the\\n/// total rTKN supply in the key of each deposit mapping, and include it in the\\n/// emmitted event. Alice and Bob must read the events offchain and make a\\n/// withdrawal relative to the rTKN supply as it was at deposit time. Many\\n/// deposits can be made under a single rTKN supply and will all combine to a\\n/// single withdrawal but deposits made across different supplies will require\\n/// multiple withdrawals.\\n///\\n/// Alice or Bob could burn their tokens before withdrawing and would simply\\n/// withdraw zero or only some of the deposited TKN. This hurts them\\n/// individually, so they SHOULD check their indexer for claimable assets in\\n/// the escrow before considering a burn. But neither of them can cause the\\n/// other to be able to withdraw more or less relative to the supply as it was\\n/// at the time of TKN being deposited, or to trick the escrow into overpaying\\n/// more TKN than was deposited under a given `Sale`.\\n///\\n/// A griefer could attempt to flood the escrow with many dust deposits under\\n/// many different supplies in an attempt to confuse alice/bob. They are free\\n/// to filter out events in their indexer that come from an unknown depositor\\n/// or fall below some dust value threshold.\\n///\\n/// Tokens may also exit the escrow as an `undeposit` call where the depositor\\n/// receives back the tokens they deposited. As above the depositor must\\n/// provide the rTKN supply from `deposit` time in order to `undeposit`.\\n///\\n/// As `withdraw` and `undeposit` both represent claims on the same tokens they\\n/// are mutually exclusive outcomes, hence the need for an escrow. The escrow\\n/// will process `withdraw` only if the `Sale` is reporting a complete and\\n/// successful raise. Similarly `undeposit` will only return tokens after the\\n/// `Sale` completes and reports failure. While the `Sale` is in active\\n/// distribution neither `withdraw` or `undeposit` will move tokens. This is\\n/// necessary in part because it is only safe to calculate entitlements once\\n/// the redeemable tokens are fully distributed and frozen.\\n///\\n/// Because much of the redeemable token supply will never be sold, and then\\n/// burned, `depositPending` MUST be called rather than `deposit` while the\\n/// raise is active. When the raise completes anon can call `sweepPending`\\n/// which will calculate and emit a `Deposit` event for a useful `supply`.\\n///\\n/// Any supported ERC20 token can be deposited at any time BUT ONLY under a\\n/// `Sale` contract that is the child of the `TrustFactory` that the escrow\\n/// is deployed for. `TrustEscrow` is used to prevent a `Sale` from changing\\n/// the pass/fail outcome once it is known due to a bug/attempt to double\\n/// spend escrow funds.\\n///\\n/// This mechanism is very similar to the native burn mechanism on\\n/// `redeemableERC20` itself under `redeem` but without requiring any tokens to\\n/// be burned in the process. Users can claim the same token many times safely,\\n/// simply receiving 0 tokens if there is nothing left to claim.\\n///\\n/// This does NOT support rebase/elastic token _balance_ mechanisms on the\\n/// escrowed token as the escrow has no way to track deposits/withdrawals other\\n/// than 1:1 conservation of input/output. For example, if 100 tokens are\\n/// deposited under two different trusts and then that token rebases all\\n/// balances to half, there will be 50 tokens in the escrow but the escrow will\\n/// attempt transfers up to 100 tokens between the two trusts. Essentially the\\n/// first 50 tokens will send and the next 50 tokens will fail because the\\n/// trust literally doesn't have 100 tokens at that point.\\n///\\n/// Elastic _supply_ tokens are supported as every token to be withdrawn must\\n/// be first deposited, with the caveat that if some mechanism can\\n/// mint/burn/transfer tokens out from under the escrow contract directly, this\\n/// will break internal accounting much like the rebase situation.\\n///\\n/// Using a real-world example, stETH from LIDO would be NOT be supported as\\n/// the balance changes every day to reflect incoming ETH from validators, but\\n/// wstETH IS supported as balances remain static while the underlying assets\\n/// per unit of wstETH increase each day. This is of course exactly why wstETH\\n/// was created in the first place.\\n///\\n/// Every escrowed token has a separate space in the deposited/withdrawn\\n/// mappings so that some broken/malicious/hacked token that leads to incorrect\\n/// token movement in/out of the escrow cannot impact other tokens, even for\\n/// the same trust and redeemable.\\ncontract RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow is SaleEscrow {\\n    using Math for uint256;\\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\\n\\n    /// Emitted for every successful pending deposit.\\n    /// @param sender Anon `msg.sender` depositing the token.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract deposit is under.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token that can claim this deposit.\\n    /// Implicitly snapshots the redeemable so malicious `Trust` cannot\\n    /// redirect funds later.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being deposited.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token deposited.\\n    event PendingDeposit(\\n        address sender,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Emitted every time a pending deposit is swept to a full deposit.\\n    /// @param sender Anon `msg.sender` sweeping the deposit.\\n    /// @param depositor Anon `msg.sender` who originally deposited the token.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract deposit is under.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token first reported by the trust.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being swept into a deposit.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token being swept into a deposit.\\n    event Sweep(\\n        address sender,\\n        address depositor,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Emitted for every successful deposit.\\n    /// @param sender Anon `msg.sender` triggering the deposit.\\n    /// MAY NOT be the `depositor` in the case of a pending sweep.\\n    /// @param depositor Anon `msg.sender` who originally deposited the token.\\n    /// MAY NOT be the current `msg.sender` in the case of a pending sweep.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract deposit is under.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token that can claim this deposit.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being deposited.\\n    /// @param supply rTKN supply at moment of deposit.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token deposited.\\n    event Deposit(\\n        address sender,\\n        address depositor,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 supply,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Emitted for every successful undeposit.\\n    /// @param sender Anon `msg.sender` undepositing the token.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract undeposit is from.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token that is being undeposited against.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being undeposited.\\n    /// @param supply rTKN supply at moment of deposit.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token undeposited.\\n    event Undeposit(\\n        address sender,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 supply,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Emitted for every successful withdrawal.\\n    /// @param withdrawer Anon `msg.sender` withdrawing the token.\\n    /// @param sale `ISale` contract withdrawal is from.\\n    /// @param redeemable Redeemable token used to withdraw.\\n    /// @param token `IERC20` token being withdrawn.\\n    /// @param supply rTKN supply at moment of deposit.\\n    /// @param amount Amount of token withdrawn.\\n    event Withdraw(\\n        address withdrawer,\\n        address sale,\\n        address redeemable,\\n        address token,\\n        uint256 supply,\\n        uint256 amount\\n    );\\n\\n    /// Every time an address calls `withdraw` their withdrawals increases to\\n    /// match the current `totalDeposits` for that trust/token combination.\\n    /// The token amount they actually receive is only their prorata share of\\n    /// that deposited balance.
