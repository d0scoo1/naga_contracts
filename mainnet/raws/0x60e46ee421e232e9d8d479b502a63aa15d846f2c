It integrates cross-chain protocol, NFT protocol, and EVM protocol. As a high-performance chain group that can realize the multi-chain contract interoperability of the EVM system. MyMonii serves all entrepreneurs who want to explore the blockchain world, allowing pioneer developers to freely try diverse content and applications in the MyMonii ecosystem without permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMyMonii VRF+BLS \u0421onsensus Mechanism: Solving the Problem of High-Frequency Trading\r\nIn the previous MyMonii Virtual Machine Technology article series, we have introduced REVM optimised functions based on compatibility with EVM. In short, they are adding standard library and tool kits to reduce the difficulty of development and improve coding and operating efficiency.\r\nWhen the development threshold is lowered, and many developers enter the MyMonii for ecological construction, high-frequency transactions will inevitably occur. This requires MyMonii to ensure the efficiency, fairness and security of data through a suitable mechanism to guarantee stable high-frequency transactions.\r\nThe means to ensure this is the consensus mechanism of MyMonii that this article will analyse in detail.\r\nWhat Is Consensus Mechanism\r\nIn a nutshell, the consensus mechanism is a means that \u201callows event participants to reach the same opinion on the same event\u201d. In the blockchain network, the decentralised database is called the \u201cledger\u201d, and each node can have a complete ledger. The consensus mechanism can determine which node is responsible for writing new data in the ledger and maintaining the unification of the ledger. Therefore, the consensus mechanism allows distributed systems (computer networks) to work together and maintain security.\r\nThe Importance of Consensus Mechanism\r\nLedgers of the blockchain are kept by nodes, and the ledger contents of all nodes are precisely the same. Each node can add transactions to the ledger or find transactions based on its own local ledger. This mechanism has risks: when some nodes record a transfer, and some do not, the system cannot determine the authenticity of the transfer. At this time, the existence of a consensus mechanism is essential. The consensus mechanism allows organisations to complete large-scale cluster collaboration and ensure data security without relying on any centralised organisation.\r\nTechnology Selection of Consensus Mechanism\r\nWith the emergence of various public chains, the consensus mechanism has also been developed to deal with multiple security issues accordingly. Now, a variety of technology options have been available in the industry. The following analysis will focus on PoW, PoS, and DPOS.\r\nPoW\r\nPoW \u2014 Proof of Work \u2014 is a proof of workload mechanism. Workload refers to the computing power of the miners. Miners use their computing power to mine, and the miners\u2019 computing power concentrated for mining is called pool mining. The essence of PoW mining is a process of competing for bookkeeping rights. Whether it\u2019s separate miners or mining pools, all they are fighting for is computing power. The greater the computing power (workload), the faster the calculation of the hash value of the block and the more bookkeeping rights and income earned.\r\nPoW can guarantee the security and fairness of the network. First of all, it has no other application scenarios other than mining, which ensures network security to a certain extent. Secondly, the attacker must invest more than 51% of the computing power in tampering with the result. That ratio is too much to support, which means PoW can counter DoS attacks. At the same time, since the miners obtain bookkeeping rights only related to the computing power, it also guarantees the fairness of the block production to a certain extent.\r\nHowever, PoW\u2019s computing power mechanism leads to the wasting of resources. Miners need to pass many repeated calculations to obtain the required hash value to prove the workload since the hash function is random. That will consume tons of power resources and computing equipment, which is not environmentally friendly. In addition, the calculation process of the PoW mechanism allows two miners to calculate the result simultaneously so that the soft fork will appear. Suppose miners continue to perform operations on different chains that have been forked. The chain with more robust computing power will become longer. In that case, miners\u2019 mining time will also last longer while the other fork chain is lost.\r\nPoS\r\nPoS \u2014 Proof of Stake \u2014 refers to the proof of stake mechanism, where the difficulty of mining is proportional to the share of a node in the network \u2014 aka the number of cryptocurrencies. This PoS mechanism does not require mining, nor does it consume tons of energy. The miner\u2019s income is related to the amount of cryptocurrency held by the individual and the holding time. The higher the percentage of staking equity and the longer the holding time, the greater the probability of successful mining. The emergence of PoS is to reduce the resource consumption of mining and solve the soft fork problem of PoW.\r\nBut PoS can result in Matthew effect and security issues. Since it determines the efficiency by the number of tokens held, the more people who own more tokens, the easier it is to gain more benefits. It will cause the \u201cthe stronger becomes stronger, weaker become weaker\u201d phenomenon, meaning smaller users\u2019 would lose their right to speak. Worse, they wouldn\u2019t care about voting governance and ecological construction, contrary to the original intention of decentralisation. Moreover, under the PoS mechanism, if someone wants to counterfeit the tokens, it would be easy to implement by holding a large amount of cryptocurrency. There is no need to invest in any complicated calculations. Compared to PoW, PoS has a lower cost when counterfeiting, and the security of PoS cannot be guaranteed.\r\nDPOS\r\nDPOS \u2014 Delegated Proof of Stake \u2014 is an authorised equity proof mechanism proposed by EOS. It is a consensus algorithm based on voting. There are two roles in DOS-notary and witness. The notary can vote to elect the block producer, the \u201cauthorised\u201d party, and the witness refers to the selected node and authorised to conduct block production and verify transactions. The advantage of this mechanism is that when a node with a large number of coins does not have enough expertise to meet the requirements of a high-performance node, the notary can take advantages to vote for high-performance nodes for block verification and transactions. This ensures the efficient operation and block generation of the chain, which is more efficient than POS. However, DPOS is currently unable to solve the dilemma caused by POS.\r\nMyMonii\u2019s Consensus Mechanism and Its Advantages\r\nMyMonii\u2019s Consensus Mechanism\r\nUnlike mainstream consensus mechanisms, MyMonii uses a more efficient and safer VRF+BLS consensus mechanism.\r\nVRF, aka the Verifiable Random Function, is an algorithm for generating random numbers. This third-generation consensus algorithm was born when the POW, PoS, and DPoS were unable to effectively solve security and efficiency issues. With the help of the latest algorithm, verifying the legitimacy of VRF has become fast, so it is an efficient consensus algorithm. In MyMonii, the VRF algorithm selects candidate block packagers and candidate block verification groups.\r\n*/\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.17;\r\ninterface IERC20 {\r\n    function totalSupply()
