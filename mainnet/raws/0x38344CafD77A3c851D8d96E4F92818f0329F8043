It was established by Dutch merchants in Amsterdam. As Joseph de la Vega, speculator, investor, merchant and author of Confusion de Confusiones 1688, the oldest book on speculation published in 1688, wrote:\r\n\r\n\u201cAmong the plays which men perform in taking different parts in this magnificent world theatre, the greatest comedy is played at the Exchange. There, in an inimitable fashion, the speculators excel in tricks, they do business and find excuses wherein hiding-places, concealment of facts , quarrels, provocations, mockery, idle talk, violent desires, collusion, artful deception, betrayals, cheatings, and even the tragic end are to be found.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the stock market, trading was based on mutual trust \u2013 (Only since he published in 1688, i.e. he must have noticed much earlier what he noticed, does the statement \u201cin the early days of the stock market, trading was based on mutual trust\u201d have anything to do with the truth at all? Are we talking about beginnings in the sense of the first few minutes? Because de la Vega proves that the dirty games started right from the beginning).\r\n\r\nOver time, especially since the end of the 1920s, when Wallstreet had its big crash, trade gradually began to be subject to various regulations, the aim of which was, above all, to protect small investors and level their chances in \u201cclashing\u201d with big \u201cfish\u201d, or \u201cwhales\u201d as we call them now. What should be regulated by the market itself, began to be the domain of officials who, despite their best intentions, rather than helping small investors, harmed them more, gradually increasing the advantage of Wallstret over Mainstreet. This led to a clear restriction of freedom of speech \u2013 from now on you had to be careful with whom you spoke, what you spoke about and how you spoke. All this to avoid being accused of manipulation and acting against the new law.\r\n\r\nThe short squeeze action on GameStop carried out by the Reddit community connected to the Wallstreetbets forum made us realise that fair play is a fantasy and market reality proves that there are equal and more equal investors. Thus, the head of a hedge fund with X investors under him, i.e. being in \u201cagreement\u201d with them or making investment decisions on their behalf, is better treated than investors acting independently on their own account and on their behalf, supporting each other and consulting their investment movements with each other.\r\n\r\nSupervisory authorities such as ESMA (the European Securities and Markets Authority) criticised the action on GameStop, but focused their criticism on the weakest and smallest players, who were, after all, acting lawfully in exercising their rights to have opinions and to share them with other free people.\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, this approach violates the natural and inalienable right to decide on one\u2019s own property. It has emerged that private investors exercising their fundamental right to have an opinion and act accordingly on the market are being restricted, their freedom of expression curtailed and their perfectly legal activities demonised. In the cases cited above, it was the fund that acted to the detriment of small investors by manipulating GameStop\u2019s shares (and it was by no means the first such manipulation). In the face of such \u2018tricks\u2019, small investors do not stand much of a chance against the rich whales of Wall Street, especially when the bodies set up to protect the weak actually favour the strong, giving their enormous capital an advantage.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the idea was born to build a decentralised and encrypted tool in which users\u2019 privacy would be protected in the name of the values that belong to us naturally, that we all possess and that we consider to be the greatest good. To achieve this, we must take risks and oppose oppressive, unfair and unjust laws that restrict freedom.\r\n\r\nA final, but equally important advantage is the size of the capital and this can only be levelled in the way it was with the last action on GameStop \u2013 it must result from coordinated efforts by individual investors. In response to the above situation, we are building a \u201cbottom-up\u201d tool that enables encrypted and fully secure communication between users based on a token and blockchain network. The free exchange of data in the information market will allow the same or even faster access to news than from giants such as Reuters and Bloomberg, thus breaking their monopoly on first-hand knowledge.\r\n\r\nBigShortBets tools will allow to coordinate the activities of groups of smaller investors, which in turn will contribute to reducing the advantage of investment funds and their more effective play.\r\n\r\nZaorski, You Son of a bitch I\u2019m in \u2026\r\n*/\r\ninterface IUniswapV2Router {\r\n    function factory() external pure returns (address);\r\n    function WETH() external
