The following text has been\r\n\t/// lifted from WikiPedia on 8 June 2018, the date of creation of this token.\r\n\t/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams\r\n\t/// Douglas Noel Adams (11 March 1952 \u2013 11 May 2001) was an English author, scriptwriter,\r\n\t/// essayist, humorist, satirist and dramatist. Adams was author of The Hitchhiker's Guide\r\n\t/// to the Galaxy, which originated in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy before developing into a\r\n\t/// \"trilogy\" of five books that sold more than 15 million copies in his lifetime and generated\r\n\t/// a television series, several stage plays, comics, a computer game, and in 2005 a feature film.\r\n\t/// Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy's Hall of Fame. Adams\r\n\t/// also wrote Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987) and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the\r\n\t/// Soul (1988), and co-wrote The Meaning of Liff (1983), The Deeper Meaning of Liff (1990), Last\r\n\t/// Chance to See (1990), and three stories for the television series Doctor Who; he also served\r\n\t/// as script editor for the show's seventeenth season in 1979. A posthumous collection of his\r\n\t/// works, including an unfinished novel, was published as The Salmon of Doubt in 2002.\r\n\t///\r\n\t/// Adams was an advocate for environmentalism and conservation, a lover of fast cars,\r\n\t/// technological innovation and the Apple Macintosh, and a radical atheist.\r\n\t///\r\n    /// Early life: Adams was born on 11 March 1952 to Janet (n\u00e9e Donovan; 1927\u20132016) and\r\n\t/// Christopher Douglas Adams (1927\u20131985) in Cambridge, England.[3] The family moved to the East\r\n\t/// End of London a few months after his birth, where his sister, Susan, was born three years later.\r\n\t/// His parents divorced in 1957; Douglas, Susan, and their mother moved to an RSPCA animal shelter\r\n\t/// in Brentwood, Essex, run by his maternal grandparents.\r\n\t///\r\n    /// Education: Adams attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. At nine, he passed the\r\n\t/// entrance exam for Brentwood School, an independent school whose alumni include Robin Day,\r\n\t/// Jack Straw, Noel Edmonds, and David Irving. Griff Rhys Jones was a year below him, and he was in\r\n\t/// the same class as Stuckist artist Charles Thomson. He attended the prep school from 1959 to 1964,\r\n\t/// then the main school until December 1970. Adams was 6 feet (1.8 m) by age 12 and stopped growing\r\n\t/// at 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m). His form master, Frank Halford, said his height had made him stand out\r\n\t/// and that he had been self-conscious about it. His ability to write stories made him well known in\r\n\t/// the school. He became the only student ever to be awarded a ten out of ten by Halford for creative\r\n\t/// writing, something he remembered for the rest of his life, particularly when facing writer's block.\r\n\t/// Some of his earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on its photography club\r\n\t/// in The Brentwoodian in 1962, or spoof reviews in the school magazine Broadsheet, edited by Paul Neil\r\n\t/// Milne Johnstone, who later became a character in The Hitchhiker's Guide. He also designed the cover\r\n\t/// of one issue of the Broadsheet, and had a letter and short story published in The Eagle, the boys'\r\n\t/// comic, in 1965. A poem entitled \"A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an\r\n\t/// account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining\" written by Adams in January 1970, at the age\r\n\t/// of 17, was discovered in a cupboard at the school in early 2014. On the strength of a bravura essay\r\n\t/// on religious poetry that discussed the Beatles and William Blake, he was awarded an Exhibition in\r\n\t/// English at St John's College, Cambridge, going up in 1971. He wanted to join the Footlights, an\r\n\t/// invitation-only student comedy club that has acted as a hothouse for comic talent. He was not\r\n\t/// elected immediately as he had hoped, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams\r\n\t/// (no relation) and Martin Smith, forming a group called \"Adams-Smith-Adams\", but became a member of\r\n\t/// the Footlights by 1973. Despite doing very little work\u2014he recalled having completed three essays in\r\n\t/// three years\u2014he graduated in 1974 with a B.A. in English literature.\r\n    /// \r\n    /// Career: Writing: After leaving university Adams moved back to London, determined to break into TV\r\n\t/// and radio as a writer. An edited version of the Footlights Revue appeared on BBC2 television in 1974.\r\n\t/// A version of the Revue performed live in London's West End led to Adams being discovered by Monty\r\n\t/// Python's Graham Chapman. The two formed a brief writing partnership, earning Adams a writing credit\r\n\t/// in episode 45 of Monty Python for a sketch called \"Patient Abuse\". The pair also co-wrote the\r\n\t/// \"Marilyn Monroe\" sketch which appeared on the soundtrack album of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\r\n\t/// Adams is one of only two people other than the original Python members to get a writing credit (the\r\n\t/// other being Neil Innes). Adams had two brief appearances in the fourth series of Monty Python's Flying\r\n\t/// Circus. At the beginning of episode 42, \"The Light Entertainment War\", Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as\r\n\t/// Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Michael Palin narrates a\r\n\t/// sketch that introduces one person after another but never gets started. At the beginning of episode 44,\r\n\t/// \"Mr. Neutron\", Adams is dressed in a pepper-pot outfit and loads a missile onto a cart driven by\r\n\t/// Terry Jones, who is calling for scrap metal (\"Any old iron...\"). The two episodes were broadcast in\r\n\t/// November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including Out of the Trees. At\r\n\t/// this point Adams's career stalled; his writing style was unsuited to the then-current style of radio\r\n\t/// and TV comedy. To make ends meet he took a series of odd jobs, including as a hospital porter, barn\r\n\t/// builder, and chicken shed cleaner. He was employed as a bodyguard by a Qatari family, who had made\r\n\t/// their fortune in oil. During this time Adams continued to write and submit sketches, though few were\r\n\t/// accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed Unpleasantness at\r\n\t/// Brodie's Close at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a\r\n\t/// depressed Adams moved to live with his mother. The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence\r\n\t/// became a feature of Adams's life; \"I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [..] I briefly did\r\n\t/// therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix\r\n\t/// the weather \u2013 you just have to get on with it\". Some of Adams's early radio work included sketches for\r\n\t/// The Burkiss Way in 1977 and The News Huddlines. He also wrote, again with Chapman, 20 February 1977\r\n\t/// episode of Doctor on the Go, a sequel to the Doctor in the House television comedy series. After the\r\n\t/// first radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer,\r\n\t/// working on Week Ending and a pantomime called Black Cinderella Two Goes East. He left after six months\r\n\t/// to become the script editor for Doctor Who. In 1979 Adams and John Lloyd wrote scripts for two half-hour\r\n\t/// episodes of Doctor Snuggles: \"The Remarkable Fidgety River\" and \"The Great Disappearing Mystery\"\r\n\t/// (episodes eight and twelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original Hitchhiker\r\n\t/// radio series (\"Fit the Fifth\" and \"Fit the Sixth\", also known as \"Episode Five\" and \"Episode Six\"), as\r\n\t/// well as The Meaning of Liff and The Deeper Meaning of Liff.\r\n\t///\r\n    /// The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was a concept for a\r\n\t/// science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer Simon Brett to BBC Radio 4 in\r\n\t/// 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in\r\n\t/// Neil Gaiman's book Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion) that could be\r\n\t/// used in the series. According to Adams, the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a\r\n\t/// field in Innsbruck, Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to\r\n\t/// Europe, and it occurred to him that \"somebody ought to write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". He\r\n\t/// later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.\r\n\t/// Despite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to John Lloyd\r\n\t/// for help with the final two episodes of the first series. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished\r\n\t/// science fiction book of his own, called GiGax. Very little of Lloyd's material survived in later\r\n\t/// adaptations of Hitchhiker's, such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first\r\n\t/// six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written. BBC Radio 4 broadcast the\r\n\t/// first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. The series was distributed in the United\r\n\t/// States by National Public Radio. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded\r\n\t/// and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. A second series of five episodes was\r\n\t/// broadcast one per night, during the week of 21\u201325 January 1980. While working on the radio series (and\r\n\t/// with simultaneous projects such as The Pirate Planet) Adams developed problems keeping to writing\r\n\t/// deadlines that got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be\r\n\t/// forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three\r\n\t/// weeks to ensure that So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish was completed. He was quoted as saying, \"I love\r\n\t/// deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.\" Despite the difficulty with deadlines,\r\n\t/// Adams wrote five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1992. The books formed the\r\n\t/// basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books,\r\n\t/// an interactive text-adventure computer game, and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This\r\n\t/// latter edition featured a 42 Puzzle designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers\r\n\t/// of the first four Hitchhiker's novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardback\r\n\t/// edition). In 1980 Adams began attempts to turn the first Hitchhiker's novel into a film, making several\r\n\t/// trips to Los Angeles, and working with Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, the radio\r\n\t/// series became the basis for a BBC television mini-series broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in\r\n\t/// California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started with Disney, which had bought the\r\n\t/// rights in 1998. The screenplay got a posthumous re-write by Karey Kirkpatrick, and the resulting film was\r\n\t/// released in 2005. Radio producer Dirk Maggs had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and\r\n\t/// 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the Hitchhiker's series. They also\r\n\t/// discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book \"trilogy\". As\r\n\t/// with the movie, this project was realised only after Adams's death. The third series, The Tertiary Phase,\r\n\t/// was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of\r\n\t/// a recording of his reading of Life, the Universe and Everything and editing, Adams can be heard playing\r\n\t/// the part of Agrajag posthumously. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish and Mostly Harmless made up the\r\n\t/// fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled The Quandary Phase and The\r\n\t/// Quintessential Phase) and these were broadcast in May and June 2005, and also subsequently released on\r\n\t/// Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, \"more upbeat\" ending) concluded with, \"The very\r\n\t/// final episode of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its\r\n\t/// author.\"\r\n    /// \r\n    /// Dirk Gently series: Between Adams's first trip to Madagascar with Mark Carwardine in 1985, and their series\r\n\t/// of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book Last Chance to See, Adams wrote\r\n\t/// two other novels with a new cast of characters. Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency was published in 1987,\r\n\t/// and was described by its author as \"a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly\r\n\t/// concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics\". It was derived from two Doctor Who serials Adams had written.\r\n\t/// A sequel, The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, was published a year later. This was an entirely original work,\r\n\t/// Adams's first since So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish. After the book tour, Adams set off on his\r\n\t/// round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for Last Chance to See.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Doctor Who: Adams sent the script for the HHGG pilot radio programme to the Doctor Who production office in\r\n\t/// 1978, and was commissioned to write The Pirate Planet (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit\r\n\t/// a potential movie script, called \"Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen\", which later became his novel Life, the\r\n\t/// Universe and Everything (which in turn became the third Hitchhiker's Guide radio series). Adams then went on\r\n\t/// to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three Doctor Who\r\n\t/// serials starring Tom Baker as the Doctor: \"The Pirate Planet\" (the second serial in the \"Key to Time\" arc, in\r\n\t/// season 16) \"City of Death\" (with producer Graham Williams, from an original storyline by writer David Fisher.\r\n\t/// It was transmitted under the pseudonym \"David Agnew\") \"Shada\" (only partially filmed; not televised due to\r\n\t/// industry disputes) The episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that were not novelised as Adams would\r\n\t/// not allow anyone else to write them, and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay.\r\n\t/// \"Shada\" was later adapted as a novel by Gareth Roberts in 2012 and \"City of Death\" and \"The Pirate Planet\" by\r\n\t/// James Goss in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Elements of Shada and City of Death were reused in Adams's later\r\n\t/// novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, in particular the character of Professor Chronotis. Big Finish\r\n\t/// Productions eventually remade Shada as an audio play starring Paul McGann as the Doctor. Accompanied by\r\n\t/// partially animated illustrations, it was webcast on the BBC website in 2003, and subsequently released as a\r\n\t/// two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station BBC7\r\n\t/// on 10 December 2005. In the Doctor Who 2012 Christmas episode The Snowmen, writer Steven Moffat was inspired by\r\n\t/// a storyline that Adams pitched called The Doctor Retires.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Music: Adams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died\r\n\t/// (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied piano in the 1960s with the same teacher as Paul\r\n\t/// Wickens, the pianist who plays in Paul McCartney's band (and composed the music for the 2004\u20132005 editions of\r\n\t/// the Hitchhiker's Guide radio series). Pink Floyd and Procol Harum had important influence on Adams' work.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Pink Floyd: Adams's official biography shares its name with the song \"Wish You Were Here\" by Pink Floyd. Adams\r\n\t/// was friends with Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour and, on Adams's 42nd birthday, he was invited to make a\r\n\t/// guest appearance at Pink Floyd's concert of 28 October 1994 at Earls Court in London, playing guitar on the\r\n\t/// songs \"Brain Damage\" and \"Eclipse\". Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd's 1994 album, The Division Bell, by\r\n\t/// picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, \"High Hopes\". Gilmour also performed at Adams's\r\n\t/// memorial service in 2001, and what would have been Adams's 60th birthday party in 2012.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Computer games and projects: Douglas Adams created an interactive fiction version of HHGG with Steve Meretzky\r\n\t/// from Infocom in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a week-long brainstorming session with the Lucasfilm Games\r\n\t/// team for the game Labyrinth. Later he was also involved in creating Bureaucracy as a parody of events in his\r\n\t/// own life. Adams was a founder-director and Chief Fantasist of The Digital Village, a digital media and Internet\r\n\t/// company with which he created Starship Titanic, a Codie Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated adventure game, which\r\n\t/// was published in 1998 by Simon & Schuster. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled Douglas Adams'\r\n\t/// Starship Titanic, since Adams was too busy with the computer game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the\r\n\t/// h2g2 collaborative writing project, an experimental attempt at making The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a\r\n\t/// reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community. It was hosted by BBC Online from\r\n\t/// 2001 to 2011. In 1990, Adams wrote and presented a television documentary programme Hyperland which featured Tom\r\n\t/// Baker as a \"software agent\" (similar to the assistant pictured in Apple's Knowledge Navigator video of future\r\n\t/// concepts from 1987), and interviews with Ted Nelson, the co-inventor of hypertext and the person who coined the\r\n\t/// term. Adams was an early adopter and advocate of hypertext.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Personal beliefs and activism: Atheism and views on religion: Adams described himself as a \"radical atheist\",\r\n\t/// adding \"radical\" for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told American Atheists that\r\n\t/// this conveyed the fact that he really meant it. He imagined a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and\r\n\t/// thinks, \"This is an interesting world I find myself in \u2013 an interesting hole I find myself in \u2013 fits me rather\r\n\t/// neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!\" to demonstrate\r\n\t/// his view that the fine-tuned Universe argument for God was a fallacy. He remained fascinated by religion because\r\n\t/// of its effect on human affairs. \"I love to keep poking and prodding at it. I've thought about it so much over the\r\n\t/// years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing.\" The evolutionary biologist and atheist\r\n\t/// Richard Dawkins uses Adams's influence to exemplify arguments for non-belief in his 2006 book The God Delusion.\r\n\t/// Dawkins dedicated the book to Adams, whom he jokingly called \"possibly [my] only convert\" to atheism and wrote on\r\n\t/// his death that \"Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the mountain gorilla and the black\r\n\t/// rhino have lost a gallant defender.\"\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Environmental activism: Adams was also an environmental activist who campaigned on behalf of endangered species.\r\n\t/// This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series Last Chance to See, in which he and\r\n\t/// naturalist Mark Carwardine visited rare species such as the kakapo and baiji, and the publication of a tie-in\r\n\t/// book of the same name. In 1992 this was made into a CD-ROM combination of audiobook, e-book and picture slide show.\r\n\t/// Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the 'Meeting a Gorilla' passage from Last Chance to See to the book\r\n\t/// The Great Ape Project. This book, edited by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer, launched a wider-scale project in\r\n\t/// 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human and non-human. In 1994, he\r\n\t/// participated in a climb of Mount Kilimanjaro while wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organisation Save\r\n\t/// the Rhino International. Puppeteer William Todd-Jones, who had originally worn the suit in the London Marathon to\r\n\t/// raise money and bring awareness to the group, also participated in the climb wearing a rhino suit; Adams wore the\r\n\t/// suit while travelling to the mountain before the climb began. About \u00a3100,000 was raised through that event,\r\n\t/// benefiting schools in Kenya and a black rhinoceros preservation programme in Tanzania. Adams was also an active\r\n\t/// supporter of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Since 2003, Save the Rhino has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial\r\n\t/// Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Technology and innovation: Adams bought his first word processor in 1982, having considered one as early as 1979.\r\n\t/// His first purchase was a Nexu. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went to Los Angeles, he bought a DEC Rainbow. Upon\r\n\t/// their return to England, Adams bought an Apricot, then a BBC Micro and a Tandy 1000. In Last Chance to See Adams\r\n\t/// mentions his Cambridge Z88, which he had taken to Zaire on a quest to find the northern white rhinoceros. Adams's\r\n\t/// posthumously published work, The Salmon of Doubt, features several articles by him on the subject of technology,\r\n\t/// including reprints of articles that originally ran in MacUser magazine, and in The Independent on Sunday newspaper.\r\n\t/// In these Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a Commodore PET, and that he had \"adored\" his\r\n\t/// Apple Macintosh (\"or rather my family of however many Macintoshes it is that I've recklessly accumulated over the\r\n\t/// years\") since he first saw one at Infocom's offices in Boston in 1984. Adams was a Macintosh user from the time they\r\n\t/// first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the first person to buy a Mac in Europe (the second being\r\n\t/// Stephen Fry \u2013 though some accounts differ on this, saying Fry bought his Mac first. Fry claims he was second to\r\n\t/// Adams). Adams was also an \"Apple Master\", celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (others\r\n\t/// included John Cleese and Gregory Hines). Adams's contributions included a rock video that he created using the\r\n\t/// first version of iMovie with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video was available on Adams's .Mac\r\n\t/// homepage. Adams installed and started using the first release of Mac OS X in the weeks leading up to his death. His\r\n\t/// very last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its Cocoa programming framework.\r\n\t/// He said it was \"awesome...\", which was also the last word he wrote on his site. Adams used email to correspond with\r\n\t/// Steve Meretzky in the early 1980s, during their collaboration on Infocom's version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the\r\n\t/// Galaxy. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own USENET\r\n\t/// newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy.\r\n\t/// Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to\r\n\t/// avoid the issue. In 1996, Adams was a keynote speaker at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC)\r\n\t/// where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device. The video of his keynote speech is archived\r\n\t/// on Channel 9. Adams was also a keynote speaker for the April 2001 Embedded Systems Conference in San Francisco, one\r\n\t/// of the major technical conferences on embedded system engineering.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Personal life: Adams moved to Upper Street, Islington, in 1981 and to Duncan Terrace, a few minutes' walk away,\r\n\t/// in the late 1980s. In the early 1980s Adams had an affair with novelist Sally Emerson, who was separated from her\r\n\t/// husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his book Life, the Universe and Everything to Emerson. In 1981 Emerson\r\n\t/// returned to her husband, Peter Stothard, a contemporary of Adams's at Brentwood School, and later editor of The\r\n\t/// Times. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson\r\n\t/// was the \"lady barrister\" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s\r\n\t/// (\"He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh\"). The two lived in Los Angeles\r\n\t/// together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of Hitchhiker's. When the deal fell\r\n\t/// through, they moved back to London, and after several separations (\"He is currently not certain where he lives,\r\n\t/// or with whom\") and a broken engagement, they married on 25 November 1991. Adams and Belson had one daughter together,\r\n\t/// Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on 22 June 1994, shortly after Adams turned 42. In 1999 the family moved from London to\r\n\t/// Santa Barbara, California, where they lived until his death. Following the funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams\r\n\t/// returned to London. Belson died on 7 September 2011 of cancer, aged 59.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t/// Death and legacy: Adams died of a heart attack on 11 May 2001, aged 49, after resting from his regular workout at a\r\n\t/// private gym in Montecito, California. Adams had been due to deliver the commencement address at Harvey Mudd College\r\n\t/// on 13 May. His funeral was held on 16 May in Santa Barbara. His ashes were placed in Highgate Cemetery in north\r\n\t/// London in June 2002. A memorial service was held on 17 September 2001 at St Martin-in-the-Fields church, Trafalgar\r\n\t/// Square, London. This became the first church service broadcast live on the web by the BBC. Video clips of the\r\n\t/// service are still available on the BBC's website for download. One of his last public appearances was a talk given\r\n\t/// at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Parrots, the universe and everything, recorded days before his death.\r\n\t/// A full transcript of the talk is available, and the university has made the full video available on YouTube. Two\r\n\t/// days before Adams died, the Minor Planet Center announced the naming of asteroid 18610 Arthurdent. In 2005, the\r\n\t/// asteroid 25924 Douglasadams was named in his memory. In May 2002, The Salmon of Doubt was published, containing many\r\n\t/// short stories, essays, and letters, as well as eulogies from Richard Dawkins, Stephen Fry (in the UK edition),\r\n\t/// Christopher Cerf (in the US edition), and Terry Jones (in the US paperback edition). It also includes eleven\r\n\t/// chapters of his unfinished novel, The Salmon of Doubt, which was originally intended to become a new Dirk Gently\r\n\t/// novel, but might have later become the sixth Hitchhiker novel. Other events after Adams's death included a webcast\r\n\t/// production of Shada, allowing the complete story to be told, radio dramatisations of the final three books in the\r\n\t/// Hitchhiker's series, and the completion of the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The film,\r\n\t/// released in 2005, posthumously credits Adams as a producer, and several design elements \u2013 including a head-shaped\r\n\t/// planet seen near the end of the film \u2013 incorporated Adams's features. A 12-part radio series based on the Dirk Gently\r\n\t/// novels was announced in 2007. BBC Radio 4 also commissioned a third Dirk Gently radio series based on the incomplete\r\n\t/// chapters of The Salmon of Doubt, and written by Kim Fuller;[66] but this was dropped in favour of a BBC TV series\r\n\t/// based on the two completed novels.[67] A sixth Hitchhiker novel, And Another Thing..., by Artemis Fowl author Eoin\r\n\t/// Colfer, was released on 12 October 2009 (the 30th anniversary of the first book), published with the support of\r\n\t/// Adams's estate. A BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime adaptation and an audio book soon followed. On 25 May 2001, two weeks\r\n\t/// after Adams's death, his fans organised a tribute known as Towel Day, which has been observed every year since then.\r\n\t/// In 2011, over 3,000 people took part in a public vote to choose the subjects of People's Plaques in Islington;\r\n\t/// Adams received 489 votes. On 11 March 2013, Adams's 61st birthday was celebrated with an interactive Google Doodle.\r\n\t/// In 2018, John Lloyd presented an hour-long episode of the BBC Radio Four documentary Archive on 4, discussing Adams'\r\n\t/// private papers, which are held at St John's College, Cambridge. The episode is available online. A street in\r\n\t/// S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, Santa Catarina, Brazil is named in Adams' honour.\r\n\t/// \r\n\t\r\ncontract Token {\r\n\r\n    /// @return total amount of tokens\r\n    function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 supply) {}\r\n\r\n    /// @param _owner The address from which the balance will be retrieved\r\n    /// @return The balance\r\n    function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance) {}\r\n\r\n    /// @notice send `_value` token to `_to` from `msg.sender`\r\n    /// @param _to The address of the recipient\r\n    /// @param _value The amount of token to be transferred\r\n    /// @return Whether the transfer was successful or not\r\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {}\r\n\r\n    /// @notice send `_value` token to `_to` from `_from` on the condition it is approved by `_from`\r\n    /// @param _from The address of the sender\r\n    /// @param _to The address of the recipient\r\n    /// @param _value The amount of token to be transferred\r\n    /// @return Whether the transfer was successful or not\r\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {}\r\n\r\n    /// @notice `msg.sender` approves `_addr` to spend `_value` tokens\r\n    /// @param _spender The address of the account able to transfer the tokens\r\n    /// @param _value The amount of wei to be approved for transfer\r\n    /// @return Whether the approval was successful or not\r\n    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {}\r\n\r\n    /// @param _owner The address of the account owning tokens\r\n    /// @param _spender The address of the account able to transfer the tokens\r\n    /// @return Amount of remaining tokens allowed to spent\r\n    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint256 remaining) {}\r\n\r\n    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);\r\n    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract StandardToken is Token {\r\n\r\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {\r\n        //Default assumes totalSupply can't be over max (2^256 - 1).\r\n        //If your token leaves out totalSupply and can issue more tokens as time goes on, you need to check if it doesn't wrap.\r\n        //Replace the if with this one instead.\r\n        //if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && balances[_to] + _value > balances[_to]) {\r\n        if (balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _value > 0) {\r\n            balances[msg.sender] -= _value;\r\n            balances[_to] += _value;\r\n            Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);\r\n            return true;\r\n        } else { return false; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success) {\r\n        //same as above.
