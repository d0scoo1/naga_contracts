        The flash loan functionality in dydx is predicated by their "operate" function,
        which takes a list of operations to execute, and defers validating the state of
        things until it's done executing them.
        
        We thus create three operations, a Withdraw (which loans us the funds), a Call
        (which invokes the callFunction method on this contract), and a Deposit (which
        repays the loan, plus the 2 wei fee), and pass them all to "operate".
        
        Note that the Deposit operation will invoke the transferFrom to pay the loan 
        (or whatever amount it was initialised with) back to itself, there is no need
        to pay it back explicitly.
        
        The loan must be given as an ERC-20 token, so WETH is used instead of ETH. Other
        currencies (DAI, USDC) are also available, their index can be looked up by
        calling getMarketTokenAddress on the solo margin contract, and set as the 
        primaryMarketId in the Withdraw and Deposit definitions.
