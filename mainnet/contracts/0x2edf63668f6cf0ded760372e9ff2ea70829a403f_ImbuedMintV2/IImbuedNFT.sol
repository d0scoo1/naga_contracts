/** @title NFT contract for imbued works of art
    @author 0xsublime.eth
    @notice This contract is the persistent center of the Imbued Art project,
    and allows unstoppable ownership of the NFTs. The minting is controlled by a
    separate contract, which is upgradeable. This contract enforces a 700 token
    limit: 7 editions of 100 tokens.

    The dataContract is intended to serve as a store for metadata, animations,
    code, etc.

    The owner of a token can imbue it with meaning. The imbuement is a string,
    up to 32 bytes long. The history of a tokens owenrship and its imbuements
    are stored and are retrievable via view functions.

    Token transfers are initially turned off for all editions. Once a transfers
    are activated on an edition of tokens, it cannot be disallowed again.
