    MUNI (Managed Uni)

    As of Uniswap V3, liquidity positions will be represented by an NFT.
    Managing LPs efficiently is within the protocols interest, such as
    concentrating liquidity between a certain range for like-minded pairs.

    MUNI will be responsible for managing said positions while issuing out a ERC20 token as a receipt
