/// @title Cooldown
/// @notice `Cooldown` is a base contract that rate limits functions on
/// the implementing contract per `msg.sender`.
///
/// Each time a function with the `onlyAfterCooldown` modifier is called the
/// `msg.sender` must wait N blocks before calling any modified function.
///
/// This does nothing to prevent sybils who can generate an arbitrary number of
/// `msg.sender` values in parallel to spam a contract.
///
/// `Cooldown` is intended to prevent rapid state cycling to grief a contract,
/// such as rapidly locking and unlocking a large amount of capital in the
/// `SeedERC20` contract.
///
/// Requiring a lock/deposit of significant economic stake that sybils will not
/// have access to AND applying a cooldown IS a sybil mitigation. The economic
/// stake alone is NOT sufficient if gas is cheap as sybils can cycle the same
/// stake between each other. The cooldown alone is NOT sufficient as many
/// sybils can be created, each as a new `msg.sender`.
///
/// @dev Base for anything that enforces a cooldown delay on functions.
/// `Cooldown` requires a minimum time in blocks to elapse between actions that
/// cooldown. The modifier `onlyAfterCooldown` both enforces and triggers the
/// cooldown. There is a single cooldown across all functions per-contract
/// so any function call that requires a cooldown will also trigger it for
/// all other functions.
///
/// Cooldown is NOT an effective sybil resistance alone, as the cooldown is
/// per-address only. It is always possible for many accounts to be created
/// to spam a contract with dust in parallel.
/// Cooldown is useful to stop a single account rapidly cycling contract
/// state in a way that can be disruptive to peers. Cooldown works best when
/// coupled with economic stake associated with each state change so that
/// peers must lock capital during the cooldown. `Cooldown` tracks the first
/// `msg.sender` it sees for a call stack so cooldowns are enforced across
/// reentrant code. Any function that enforces a cooldown also has reentrancy
/// protection.
