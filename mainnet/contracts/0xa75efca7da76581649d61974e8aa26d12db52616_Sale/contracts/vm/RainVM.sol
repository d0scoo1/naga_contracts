/// @notice micro VM for implementing and executing custom contract DSLs.

/// runs rain scripts using these opcodes. Rain scripts dispatch as pairs of
/// bytes. The first byte is an opcode to run and the second byte is a value
/// the opcode can use contextually to inform how to run. Typically opcodes
/// will read/write to the stack to produce some meaningful final state after
/// all opcodes have been dispatched.
///
/// The only thing required to run a rain script is a `State` struct to pass
/// to `eval`, and the index of the source to run. Additional context can
/// optionally be provided to be used by opcodes. For example, an `ITier`
/// contract can take the input of `report`, abi encode it as context, then
/// expose a local opcode that copies this account to the stack. The state will
/// be mutated by reference rather than returned by `eval`, this is to make it
/// very clear to implementers that the inline mutation is occurring.
///
/// Rain scripts run "top to bottom", i.e. "left to right".
/// See the tests for examples on how to construct rain script in JavaScript
/// then pass to `ImmutableSource` contracts deployed by a factory that then
/// run `eval` to produce a final value.
///
/// There are only 4 "core" opcodes for `RainVM`:
/// - `0`: Skip self and optionally additional opcodes, `0 0` is a noop.
///   DEPRECATED! DON'T USE SKIP!
///   See https://github.com/beehive-innovation/rain-protocol/issues/262
/// - `1`: Copy value from either `constants` or `arguments` at index `operand`
///   to the top of the stack. High bit of `operand` is `0` for `constants` and
///   `1` for `arguments`.
/// - `2`: Duplicates the value at stack index `operand_` to the top of the
///   stack.
/// - `3`: Zipmap takes N values from the stack, interprets each as an array of
///   configurable length, then zips them into `arguments` and maps a source
///   from `sources` over these. See `zipmap` for more details.
///
/// To do anything useful the contract that inherits `RainVM` needs to provide
/// opcodes to build up an internal DSL. This may sound complex but it only
/// requires mapping opcode integers to functions to call, and reading/writing
/// values to the stack as input/output for these functions. Further, opcode
/// packs are provided in rain that any inheriting contract can use as a normal
/// solidity library. See `MathOps.sol` opcode pack and the
/// `CalculatorTest.sol` test contract for an example of how to dispatch
/// opcodes and handle the results in a wrapping contract.
///
/// RainVM natively has no concept of branching logic such as `if` or loops.
/// An opcode pack could implement these similar to the core zipmap by lazily
/// evaluating a source from `sources` based on some condition, etc. Instead
/// some simpler, eagerly evaluated selection tools such as `min` and `max` in
/// the `MathOps` opcode pack are provided. Future versions of `RainVM` MAY
/// implement lazy `if` and other similar patterns.
///
/// The `eval` function is `view` because rain scripts are expected to compute
/// results only without modifying any state. The contract wrapping the VM is
/// free to mutate as usual. This model encourages exposing only read-only
/// functionality to end-user deployers who provide scripts to a VM factory.
/// Removing all writes removes a lot of potential foot-guns for rain script
/// authors and allows VM contract authors to reason more clearly about the
/// input/output of the wrapping solidity code.
///
/// Internally `RainVM` makes heavy use of unchecked math and assembly logic
/// as the opcode dispatch logic runs on a tight loop and so gas costs can ramp
/// up very quickly. Implementing contracts and opcode packs SHOULD require
/// that opcodes they receive do not exceed the codes they are expecting.
