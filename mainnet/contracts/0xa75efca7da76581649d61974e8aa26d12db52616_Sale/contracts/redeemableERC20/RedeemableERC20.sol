/// @notice This is the ERC20 token that is minted and distributed.
///
/// During `Phase.ZERO` the token can be traded and so compatible with the
/// Balancer pool mechanics.
///
/// During `Phase.ONE` the token is frozen and no longer able to be traded on
/// any AMM or transferred directly.
///
/// The token can be redeemed during `Phase.ONE` which burns the token in
/// exchange for pro-rata erc20 tokens held by the `RedeemableERC20` contract
/// itself.
///
/// The token balances can be used indirectly for other claims, promotions and
/// events as a proof of participation in the original distribution by token
/// holders.
///
/// The token can optionally be restricted by the `ITier` contract to only
/// allow receipients with a specified membership status.
///
/// @dev `RedeemableERC20` is an ERC20 with 2 phases.
///
/// `Phase.ZERO` is the distribution phase where the token can be freely
/// transfered but not redeemed.
/// `Phase.ONE` is the redemption phase where the token can be redeemed but no
/// longer transferred.
///
/// Redeeming some amount of `RedeemableERC20` burns the token in exchange for
/// some other tokens held by the contract. For example, if the
/// `RedeemableERC20` token contract holds 100 000 USDC then a holder of the
/// redeemable token can burn some of their tokens to receive a % of that USDC.
/// If they redeemed (burned) an amount equal to 10% of the redeemable token
/// supply then they would receive 10 000 USDC.
///
/// To make the treasury assets discoverable anyone can call `newTreasuryAsset`
/// to emit an event containing the treasury asset address. As malicious and/or
/// spam users can emit many treasury events there is a need for sensible
/// indexing and filtering of asset events to only trusted users. This contract
/// is agnostic to how that trust relationship is defined for each user.
///
/// Users must specify all the treasury assets they wish to redeem to the
/// `redeem` function. After `redeem` is called the redeemed tokens are burned
/// so all treasury assets must be specified and claimed in a batch atomically.
/// Note: The same amount of `RedeemableERC20` is burned, regardless of which
/// treasury assets were specified. Specifying fewer assets will NOT increase
/// the proportion of each that is returned.
///
/// `RedeemableERC20` has several owner administrative functions:
/// - Owner can add senders and receivers that can send/receive tokens even
///   during `Phase.ONE`
/// - Owner can end `Phase.ONE` during `Phase.ZERO` by specifying the address
///   of a distributor, which will have any undistributed tokens burned.
/// The owner should be a `Trust` not an EOA.
///
/// The redeem functions MUST be used to redeem and burn RedeemableERC20s
/// (NOT regular transfers).
///
/// `redeem` will simply revert if called outside `Phase.ONE`.
/// A `Redeem` event is emitted on every redemption (per treasury asset) as
/// `(redeemer, asset, redeemAmount)`.
