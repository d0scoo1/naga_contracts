/*
 * This smart contract implements voting for tokenholders of ERC20 tokens based on the principle
 * "one token - one vote"
 * It requires external script to count votes.
 *
 * Rules:
 * Voting can be started for any contract with ERC20 tokens, to start a voting an address have to own at lest one token.
 * To start a voting, voting creator must provide:
 * 1) address of a contract with tokens (ERC20),
 * 2) text of the proposal,
 * 3) number of block on witch voting will be finished and results have to be calculated.
 *
 * Every proposal for a contract receives a sequence number that serves as a proposal ID for this contract.
 * Each smart contract with tokens has its own numbering.
 * So proposal can be identified by contract address with tokens + number (ID) of the proposal.
 *
 * To vote 'for' or 'against' voter has to provide an address of a contract with tokens + proposal ID.
 *
 * In most scenarios only votes 'for' can be used, who did not voted 'for' can be considered as voted 'against'.
 * But our dApp also supports votes 'against'
 *
 * To calculate results we collect all voted addresses by an external script, which is also open sourced.
 * Than we check their balances in tokens on resulting block, and and sum up the voices.
 * Thus, for the results, the number of tokens of the voter at the moment of voting does not matter
 * (it should just has at least one).
 * What matters is the number of tokens on the voter's address on the block where the results should calculated.
 *
