/**
 * @title Grill2.0
 * @author Matt Carter, degendeveloper.eth
 * 6 June, 2022
 *
 * The purpose of this contract is to optimize gas consumption when adding new stakes and
 * removing previous stakes from the initial grill contract @ 0xE11AF478aF241FAb926f4c111d50139Ae003F7fd.
 *
 * Users will use this new grill contract when adding and removing stakes. This new contract
 * is also responsible for counting emission tokens and setting new emission rates.
 *
 * This contract is whitelisted to move the first grill's tokens via proxy registry in the super1155 contract.
 *
 * This contract should be set as the `proxyRegistryAddress` in the parent contract. This
 * allows the new grill to move tokens on behalf of the old grill.
