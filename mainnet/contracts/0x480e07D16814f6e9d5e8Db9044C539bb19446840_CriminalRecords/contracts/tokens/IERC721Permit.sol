 * @dev Interface of extending the IERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in

 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC721 approval (see {IERC721-approval}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on `{IERC721-approve}`, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
