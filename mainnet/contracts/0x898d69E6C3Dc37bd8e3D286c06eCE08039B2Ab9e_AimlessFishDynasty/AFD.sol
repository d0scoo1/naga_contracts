 * Date: March 17th, 2022
 * 
 * ☘️Happy Saint Patrick's Day!
 *
 * The Aimless Fish Dynasty is dedicated to my ever beautiful Wife, Stephanie, and our three amazing children. Hi Steph! I love you with all my heart.
 * ❤️ LHK FOREVER
 *
 * As I move on from a family business which I personally experienced as toxic to my mental health (ultimately affecting my wife and kids), I want to make all who
 * may see this aware, that Stephanie has helped me climb out of the darkness with her energy, resilience, motivation, and get-it-done attitude.
 * She has shown me strength in all areas of life, and taught me to see beyond the darkness that had surrounded me in my professional life.
 * I am forever grateful to her for this and can't express it enough. I believe everyone needs a Stephanie!
 *
 * Life is mainly about creating yourself. Who are you going to be? How will others think of you? Have you perhaps lost the plot?
 * Surround yourself with inspiring, joyful people, like my Wife, and learn from them. I think this is how you live your best life.
 *
 * Finally, within this contract I have tried to share and be as open as possible with where we are going with the Aimless Fish Dynasty project.
 * I hard coded as much as my current knowledge allowed. Where my knowledge was lacking, I tried to leave fingerprints so you could make sure things occur as they should.
 * I hope you join on me and my family on this exciting new journey!
 * This is just the beginning.
