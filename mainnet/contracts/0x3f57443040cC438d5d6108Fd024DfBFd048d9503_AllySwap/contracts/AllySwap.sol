BY CLICKING THE 'I AGREE' BUTTON AND/OR CLAIMING ALLY TOKENS (AS DEFINED BELOW), YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR CONSENT AND AGREEMENT TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT CLICK 'I AGREE' AND DO NOT CLAIM ALLY TOKENS. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE EFFECT OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL. NOTE THAT SECTION 3 OF THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A RELEASE OF CLAIMS AND LIABILITY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF SUCH RELEASE OF CLAIMS AND LIABILITY, DO NOT CLICK 'I AGREE' AND DO NOT CLAIM ALLY TOKENS. This Ally Tokens Terms and Conditions (the 'Agreement') is made between you ('You'), and ICHI Foundation, an exempted foundation company limited by guarantee formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the 'Company'). You and The Company are sometimes referred to herein individual as a Party and collectively as the Parties. This Agreement is effective as of the earliest date You either (a) agree to the terms of this Agreement by clicking 'I Agree', or (b) claim the Ally Tokens ('Effective Date'). 1. Eligibility. 1.1. The Company reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to determine whether you are eligible to receive Ally Tokens (the 'Ally Tokens') and how many Ally Tokens you are eligible to receive, and such determination may be made prior to or following the Effective Date. 1.2. In the event You are eligible to receive Ally Tokens because You hold oneTokens, you will be required to swap all such oneTokens in order to be eligible to receive Your full allocation of Ally Tokens. Any partial swap of Your oneTokens may reduce the number of Ally Tokens You are eligible to receive, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 1.3. If you do not agree to this Agreement, or if you later dispute the validity or enforceability of any provision hereof, you will not be eligible to receive any Ally Tokens and you will be required to return to the Company any Tokens (as defined below) you received pursuant to this Agreement. 1.4. In the event the Company deems you are not eligible to receive any Ally Tokens, the Company may, but shall not have any obligations to, inform you of such ineligibility, and you shall not be entitled to any Ally Tokens or any other sort of remuneration. 2. Ally Tokens. 2.1. In the event the Company determines You are eligible to receive Ally Tokens, the Company will make the correct number of Ally Tokens available to you pursuant to the procedures set forth by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion. 2.2. The Ally Tokens may be redeemed for a certain number of ICHI tokens (the 'ICHI Tokens,' and together with the Ally Tokens, the 'Tokens'); provided, however, the Company shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, how many ICHI Tokens your Ally Tokens are eligible to receive upon such redemption; provided, further, that the number of ICHI Tokens received upon redemption may vary based on the length of time the Ally Tokens are held prior to redemption. 2.3. You will be required to pay any fees, including gas fees or equivalent, required to claim the Tokens. 2.4. The Company's dealings with You and others who may receive Tokens need not be uniform, and, without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to, among other things, enter into agreements with such other persons on terms different than those set forth herein. 3. Release. 3.1. General Release. You hereby release, cancel, and forever discharge the Company, DMA Labs, Inc. ('DMA Labs') and their respective directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, lawyers, affiliates, agents, and representatives (collectively, the 'Released Parties'), from any and all claims, complaints, causes of action, demands, damages, obligations, liabilities, losses, promises, agreements, controversies, penalties, expenses, and executions of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, actual or potential, whether arising in law or in equity, which You may have, may have had, or may in the future obtain, arising out of or relating out of the acts, omissions, agreements, or events relating in any manner to the Company or DMA Labs, including, but not limited to, the ICHI protocol, ICHI Tokens, oneTokens and Rari Fuse Pool #136 (the 'Release').

You understand and agree that You hereby expressly waive any and all laws and statutes, of all jurisdictions whatsoever, which may provide that a general release does not extend to claims not known or suspected to exist at the time of executing a release which if known would have materially affected the decision to give said release. It is expressly intended and agreed that this Release does, in fact, extend to such unknown and unsuspected claims related to anything which has happened to the Effective Date which is covered by this Release, even if knowledge thereof would have materially affected the decision to give this Release. In addition, the Parties warrant and represent to the other that the execution and delivery of this Release does not, and with the passage of time will not, violate any obligation of the Party to any third party. Each Party further represents and warrants that it has not assigned any of its rights with respect to any of the matters covered by the Release. 3.3. Third Party Beneficiaries. You acknowledge and agree that each of the Released Parties is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and that each of the Released Parties is entitled to enforce the terms hereof as if such Released Party was an original party hereto. 3.4.

For purposes of Section 1542, 'creditor' refers to You and 'debtor' refers to the Released Parties. In connection with such waiver and relinquishment, You acknowledge that You are aware that You may later discover facts in addition to or different from those which You currently know or believe to be true with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, but that it is nevertheless your intention hereby to fully, finally and forever settle and release all of these matters which now exist, or previously existed, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected.
