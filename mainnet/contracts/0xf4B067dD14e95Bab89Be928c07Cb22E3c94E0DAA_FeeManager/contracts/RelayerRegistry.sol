/**
 * @notice Registry contract, one of the main contracts of this protocol upgrade.
 *         The contract should store relayers' addresses and data attributed to the
 *         master address of the relayer. This data includes the relayers stake and
 *         his ensHash.
 *         A relayers master address has a number of subaddresses called "workers",
 *         these are all addresses which burn stake in communication with the proxy.
 *         If a relayer is not registered, he is not displayed on the frontend.
 * @dev CONTRACT RISKS:
 *      - if setter functions are compromised, relayer metadata would be at risk, including the noted amount of his balance
 *      - if burn function is compromised, relayers run the risk of being unable to handle withdrawals
 *      - the above risk also applies to the nullify balance function
