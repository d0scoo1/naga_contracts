/*
TurfShop: It's an ERC1155 vending machine. It allows for multiple sales and give-aways.

Each specific mint is configured according to the options in its TurfObject struct.

Additional logic around how much a user can mint, and if they're eligible to mint at all,
can be deployed in a secondary contract defined by the `eligibilityCheckerAddress` address on a TurfObject.

See the simple TurfShopEligibilityChecker interface for how that works, or the set of examples living alongside this contract.
