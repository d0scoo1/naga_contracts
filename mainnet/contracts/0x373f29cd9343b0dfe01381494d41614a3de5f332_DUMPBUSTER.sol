ðŸ‘‹ DAY-1 PRODUCT SPEC + ROADMAP

Thank you all for your patience and continued support. We're really proud we can say that we are launching with as much functionality and efficiency as we are. A key factor in a token's cost to transact, regardless of where gas is at in a given moment, is how long it takes to execute. The more blockchain resources you utilize per second, the more expensive it will be. This is who complex token with dividends or reflections often times cost $100-200 in gas when other tokens swapping at the same Gwei transact at half that.

For as big a task as we have in combatting fraud, achieving it at efficiency that make it financially viable to transact our token even for people with only a few hundred or thousand to commit to it. Hats off to the devs on this achievement.

Without further ado (adieu?) -- here's what we're lainching day-1 at a minimum:

LAUNCH CAPABILITIES:

- Customizable blacklisting. Partners can subscribe to chain-wide lists in different categories (bots, snipers, rug pullers, etc).
- Deep-wallet trackbacking. We make it easy to look any number of degrees deep in a chain of associations and seamlessly blacklist them all. Scammers get creative with muddying transactions to hide illicit activity. DumpBuster decodes it so you don't have to.
- Irregularity tracking and Aerts. We're developing off-chain resoures that monitor and are real good at sensing inauthentic or anomalous actibities on the chain, and in your specific asset's trade book. We'll stay on guard and escalate to your attention any activity that falls outside of expected laws of large numbers with insights so you can make your own decisions for what is best for your project and community.
- Anti-Bot & Anti-Snipe Capabilities. Out-of-the-box. We're confident we have the most sophisticated tiered, layered solution for the dreaded launch snipers, bots, and supply hoarders. If you want to set initial buy and transaction limitations as many projects do, we'll make sure those rules are enforced regardless of how creative and covert a corruptive entity may try and be.
- One-Directional Call Stack. It's ciritcal for security that no centralized system or API has control over an ecosystem of tokens. Because if that system were ever compromised, the integrity of all our ecosystem projects would also be compromised. **This is not remotely a plausible risk with DumpBuster.** All transaction processing/enforcement remains inside your token's contract. We cannot call, control, or remotely access your contract -- ever. 
- Flexible and Managed Tax Assessment. One of the most revolutionary innovations to crypto tokenimics is the way in which our fees are assessed. 1.9% of your token's transactions are swapped for $GTFO tokens instead of taken off the table, and those $GTFO token are locked for a period of 90 days. After which, you can do with them what you wish as project deployers. You can just swap them back to recover your tax, even plus gains! This is the service that pays YOU to use it. A common question we get form project deployers is how that assessment takes place. Rest assured it is flexible, gas-conscious, and doesn't create more overhead to you or your staff. Reach out to josh@dumpbuster.org if you'd like to discuss possible partnership!

** While automated and artificial intelligent systems are and will continue to be a major priority for our team and at the core of the technology we develop, we want to stress that for launch, there will always be a human element involved in every step of the process to guarantee no systemic false-positives occur.ofit taking. Projects decide their own tolerances
