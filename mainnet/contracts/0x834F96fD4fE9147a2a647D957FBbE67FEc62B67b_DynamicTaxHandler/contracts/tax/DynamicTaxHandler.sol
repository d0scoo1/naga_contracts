 * - Is the address on the static blacklist? If so, it can only transfer to the
 *   `receiver` address. In all other cases, the transfer will fail.
 * - Is the address exempt from taxes, if so, the number of taxed tokens is
 *   always zero.
 * - Is it a transfer between "regular" users? This means they are not on the
 *   list of either blacklisted or exempt addresses, nor are they an address
 *   designated as an exchange pool.
 * - Is it a transfer towards or from an exchange pool? If so, the transaction
 *   is taxed according to its relative size to the exchange pool.
