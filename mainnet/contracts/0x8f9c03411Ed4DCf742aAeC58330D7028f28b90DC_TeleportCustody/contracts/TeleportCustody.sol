/**
 * @dev Implementation of the TeleportCustody contract.
 *
 * There are two priviledged roles for the contract: "owner" and "admin".
 *
 * Owner: Has the ultimate control of the contract and the funds stored inside the
 *        contract. Including:
 *     1) "freeze" and "unfreeze" the contract: when the TeleportCustody is frozen,
 *        all deposits and withdrawals with the TeleportCustody is disabled. This 
 *        should only happen when a major security risk is spotted or if admin access
 *        is comprimised.
 *     2) assign "admins": owner has the authority to grant "unlock" permission to
 *        "admins" and set proper "unlock limit" for each "admin".
 *
 * Admin: Has the authority to "unlock" specific amount to tokens to receivers.
