*
* @dev ERC20SpendableReceiver - library contract for an ERC20 extension to allow ERC20s to 
* operate as 'spendable' items, i.e. a token that can trigger an action on another contract
* at the same time as being transfered. Similar to ERC677 and the hooks in ERC777, but with more
* of an empasis on interoperability (returned values) than ERC677 and specifically scoped interaction
* rather than the general hooks of ERC777. 
*
* This library contract allows a smart contract to operate as a receiver of ERC20Spendable tokens.
