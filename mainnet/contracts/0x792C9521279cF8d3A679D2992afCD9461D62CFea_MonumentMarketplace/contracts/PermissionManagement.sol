 * Version: 2.0.0
 * Compiles best with: 0.8.4

 * Many contracts have ownerOnly functions, 
 * but I believe it's safer to have multiple owner addresses
 * to fallback to, in case you lose one.

 * You can inherit this PermissionManagement contract
 * to let multiple people do admin operations on your contract effectively.

 * You can add & remove admins and moderators.
 * You can transfer ownership (basically you can change the founder).
 * You can change the beneficiary (the prime payable wallet) as well.

 * Use modifiers like "founderOnly", "adminOnly", "moderatorOnly"
 * in your contract to put the permissions to use.
