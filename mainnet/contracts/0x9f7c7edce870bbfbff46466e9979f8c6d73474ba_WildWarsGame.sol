/*Welcome to WildWars. 
we will share our vision, introduce our team and give detailed explanations about our products. 
We will provide you with all information needed to engage with our community and products. 
WildWars will mainly revolve around Play & Earn. 
Our main focus is quality on the long run. We want to avoid rushing towards our goals because 
creating a healthy economic environment takes time and patience. This is a process in which 
we want to involve the community. Since Play & Earn is a new concept it's very innovative. 
This is both a possibility and a threath as we have lots of fresh ideas to implement but 
have a narrow database to tackle common issues. We will provide ways of earning valuable 
property which you can be the owner of, no intermediaries involved. We have seen big gaming 
corporates achieving the craving for earning digital property with virtual value. 
The blockchain enables possibilities to establish a safe & healthy economic environment to 
approach this differently, so that players truly own what they obtain. So, what is Play & 
Earn? Simply put, you can earn currency and NFT's by playing games. We collaborate with 
game developers and blockchain developers to make products/services that contain the best 
of both. If you posess the sufficient funds to participate, you can play our games with the
potential of earning valuable NFT's. But most importantly, you can enjoy a great experience
and battle your way to the top of the leaderboards.
WildWars is more than just collectibles. It is an Play-to-earn RTS NFT game taking place in 
a fantasy world. It is also an inspiration and a character in the gaming metaverse, where 
you can use your animal to participate in the game's special features, particularly the 
Play-to-earn mechanism.
After a year of progression, the decentralized gaming industry has witnessed many new 
products, which attract millions of new users who believe they can enjoy playing games & 
earning money at the same time.
Also at the same time, millions of new users mint/trade and collect Non-fungible tokens, 
or NFTs. They are the digital tokens that offer the uniqueness and every related information 
such as the creator, the current ownership, and the entire sales history that is verifiable 
in blockchain. We believe that the current trending metaverse will be the last piece to lift 
the blockchain game industry to a whole new level, where every player can enjoy games, make 
a profit or interact
with other people through chat, voice, VR and other means. That means we can truly live a 
second life in a world parallel to the real one. WildWars will contribute our part in developing 
the metaverse.

Token Summary
WildWars token (WILDWARS) is known as the governance token.
Total Supply : 600.000.000 WILDWARS
Oracle System 
The Purpose
The Oracle system's goal is to maintain the economy of the game balanced around a set dollar 
value. WildWars creates a correlation between active users and the dollar value of the WILDWARS
token by using the Oracle system. 
The Reason
The Oracle will ensure consistent dollar value payouts when it is made, and that minting costs 
for NFTs remain consistent in dollar value. This means that entry costs and rewards can be balanced
and maintained over long periods and will accurately reflect the desired minting costs, which can be appropriately reflected to allow new 
players to participate even if the WILDWARS token's dollar value rises. This is the primary function 
of the game to help balance the system, reduce selling pressure, and attract new investors with a 
variety of appealing features.
Gaming Features
1.Play And Earn
With Play-And-Earn Model instead of Play-To-Earn Model, the game focuses more on the gameplay and 
increases the player’s experiences. WildWars wants to bring the community the game battles which 
can give the players joy and financial success.
2.Recruitment
Recruitment is a feature that allows players to enlist more WILDWARS NFT Heroes by utilizing those 
they already have. You are required to hold $WILDWARS to recruit a hero. It should be noted that 
these figures may change depending on the game's economic balance. The WILDWARS required per recruitment
may be changed.
3.PVE & PVP
Use your Animal for fighting in PVE to receive rewards of WILDWARS tokens and experience for levelling. 
Higher attribute stats have an important role in getting better fighting records in the PvP arena.
4.Item Upgrading
Each WildWars has a fixed number of equipment slots depending on how rare they are. The minimum is 4 
slots and the maximum is 7 slots, and they provide a boost to the stats of the WildWars. WildWarss with 
better stats can go further and have a better chance of gaining new upgrading materials, support materials 
& WildWars NFT.
When participating in game, the player will have a chance to receive a Majestic Chest. They can open this 
chest for a small charge and have a chance to receive upgrading materials & WildWars NFT, which has a certain 
drop rate.
The upgrading material can be traded on the in-game market & secondary market.
There is a success rate when players use upgrading material. If successful, the Equipment will boost the 
WildWars stats. There is a chance that the upgrading materials will be destroyed due to failure. However, 
if players also use support material, their chance of successful upgrading will be higher.
Each time, the item upgrade will cost WILDWARS token and upgrading materials.
5.The WILDWARS Championship
The WILDWARS Championship will be scheduled automatically every weekend.
WILDWARS NFT Owners can choose to participate in the event, and if they can achieve a high rank on the 
leaderboard, they will be rewarded with a part of the WILDWARS (WildWars Token) weekly prize pool.
The tournament will have 3 main stages:
• The qualifier with Single Elimination format for unranking and low-ranking players.
• The group stage with Bo2 format for seeding players and qualified players.
• The champion stage with Bo3 & Double Elimination format.
