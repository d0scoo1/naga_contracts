     * @notice Constructs the Lift HAIF Token ERC-20 contract.
     *
     * I am the token represented by a new VAULT that acts as a hedge fund.
     * It takes in funds (from say the IdeaFund) and issues a HAIF token for the 
     * IdeaFund to hold so that it can represent value a small LP of this must be created
     * to create a value that we can track value to?  Or some other way to give this 
     * token value on Coingecko/TheGraph Protocol
     *
     * This could quickly become a project (hedgefund) so this token may be held
     * people folks other than just the IdeaFund
     *
     * Or maybe we like the idea and spin out a new token just for public facing
     * HedgeFund investing...
