/// Escrow contract for ERC20 tokens to be deposited and withdrawn against
/// redeemableERC20 tokens from a specific `Sale`.
///
/// When some token is deposited the running total of that token against the
/// trust is incremented by the deposited amount. When some `redeemableERC20`
/// token holder calls `withdraw` they are sent the full balance they have not
/// previously claimed, multiplied by their fraction of the redeemable token
/// supply that they currently hold. As redeemable tokens are frozen after
/// distribution there are no issues with holders manipulating withdrawals by
/// transferring tokens to claim multiple times.
///
/// As redeemable tokens can be burned it is possible for the total supply to
/// decrease over time, which naively would result in claims being larger
/// retroactively (prorata increases beyond what can be paid).
///
/// For example:
/// - Alice and Bob hold 50 rTKN each, 100 total supply
/// - 100 TKN is deposited
/// - Alice withdraws 50% of 100 TKN => alice holds 50 TKN escrow holds 50 TKN
/// - Alice burns her 50 rTKN
/// - Bob attempts to withdraw his 50 rTKN which is now 100% of supply
/// - Escrow tries to pay 100% of 100 TKN deposited and fails as the escrow
///   only holds 50 TKN (alice + bob = 150%).
///
/// To avoid the escrow allowing more withdrawals than deposits we include the
/// total rTKN supply in the key of each deposit mapping, and include it in the
/// emmitted event. Alice and Bob must read the events offchain and make a
/// withdrawal relative to the rTKN supply as it was at deposit time. Many
/// deposits can be made under a single rTKN supply and will all combine to a
/// single withdrawal but deposits made across different supplies will require
/// multiple withdrawals.
///
/// Alice or Bob could burn their tokens before withdrawing and would simply
/// withdraw zero or only some of the deposited TKN. This hurts them
/// individually, so they SHOULD check their indexer for claimable assets in
/// the escrow before considering a burn. But neither of them can cause the
/// other to be able to withdraw more or less relative to the supply as it was
/// at the time of TKN being deposited, or to trick the escrow into overpaying
/// more TKN than was deposited under a given `Sale`.
///
/// A griefer could attempt to flood the escrow with many dust deposits under
/// many different supplies in an attempt to confuse alice/bob. They are free
/// to filter out events in their indexer that come from an unknown depositor
/// or fall below some dust value threshold.
///
/// Tokens may also exit the escrow as an `undeposit` call where the depositor
/// receives back the tokens they deposited. As above the depositor must
/// provide the rTKN supply from `deposit` time in order to `undeposit`.
///
/// As `withdraw` and `undeposit` both represent claims on the same tokens they
/// are mutually exclusive outcomes, hence the need for an escrow. The escrow
/// will process `withdraw` only if the `Sale` is reporting a complete and
/// successful raise. Similarly `undeposit` will only return tokens after the
/// `Sale` completes and reports failure. While the `Sale` is in active
/// distribution neither `withdraw` or `undeposit` will move tokens. This is
/// necessary in part because it is only safe to calculate entitlements once
/// the redeemable tokens are fully distributed and frozen.
///
/// Because much of the redeemable token supply will never be sold, and then
/// burned, `depositPending` MUST be called rather than `deposit` while the
/// raise is active. When the raise completes anon can call `sweepPending`
/// which will calculate and emit a `Deposit` event for a useful `supply`.
///
/// Any supported ERC20 token can be deposited at any time BUT ONLY under a
/// `Sale` contract that is the child of the `TrustFactory` that the escrow
/// is deployed for. `TrustEscrow` is used to prevent a `Sale` from changing
/// the pass/fail outcome once it is known due to a bug/attempt to double
/// spend escrow funds.
///
/// This mechanism is very similar to the native burn mechanism on
/// `redeemableERC20` itself under `redeem` but without requiring any tokens to
/// be burned in the process. Users can claim the same token many times safely,
/// simply receiving 0 tokens if there is nothing left to claim.
///
/// This does NOT support rebase/elastic token _balance_ mechanisms on the
/// escrowed token as the escrow has no way to track deposits/withdrawals other
/// than 1:1 conservation of input/output. For example, if 100 tokens are
/// deposited under two different trusts and then that token rebases all
/// balances to half, there will be 50 tokens in the escrow but the escrow will
/// attempt transfers up to 100 tokens between the two trusts. Essentially the
/// first 50 tokens will send and the next 50 tokens will fail because the
/// trust literally doesn't have 100 tokens at that point.
///
/// Elastic _supply_ tokens are supported as every token to be withdrawn must
/// be first deposited, with the caveat that if some mechanism can
/// mint/burn/transfer tokens out from under the escrow contract directly, this
/// will break internal accounting much like the rebase situation.
///
/// Using a real-world example, stETH from LIDO would be NOT be supported as
/// the balance changes every day to reflect incoming ETH from validators, but
/// wstETH IS supported as balances remain static while the underlying assets
/// per unit of wstETH increase each day. This is of course exactly why wstETH
/// was created in the first place.
///
/// Every escrowed token has a separate space in the deposited/withdrawn
/// mappings so that some broken/malicious/hacked token that leads to incorrect
/// token movement in/out of the escrow cannot impact other tokens, even for
/// the same trust and redeemable.
