/**
 * @title Core Pool
 *
 * @notice An abstract contract containing common logic for ILV and ILV/ETH SLP pools.
 *
 * @dev Base smart contract for ILV and LP pool. Stores each pool user by mapping
 *      its address to the user struct. User struct stores v2 stakes, which fit
 *      in 1 storage slot each (by using the Stake lib), total weights, pending
 *      yield and revenue distributions, and v1 stake ids. ILV and LP stakes can
 *      be made through flexible stake mode, which only increments the flexible
 *      balance of a given user, or through locked staking. Locked staking creates
 *      a new Stake element fitting 1 storage slot with its value and lock duration.
 *      When calculating pending rewards, CorePool checks v1 locked stakes weights
 *      to increment in the calculations and stores pending yield and pending revenue
 *      distributions. Every time a stake or unstake related function is called,
 *      it updates pending values, but don't require instant claimings. Rewards
 *      claiming are executed in separate functions, and in the case of yield,
 *      it also requires the user checking whether ILV or sILV is wanted as the yield reward.
 *
 * @dev Deployment and initialization.
 *      After proxy is deployed and attached to the implementation, it should be
 *      registered by the PoolFactory contract
 *      Additionally, 3 token instance addresses must be defined on deployment:
 *          - ILV token address
 *          - sILV token address, used to mint sILV rewards
 *          - pool token address, it can be ILV token address, ILV/ETH pair address, and others
 *
 * @dev Pool weight defines the fraction of the yield current pool receives among the other pools,
 *      pool factory is responsible for the weight synchronization between the pools.
 * @dev The weight is logically 20% for ILV pool and 80% for ILV/ETH pool initially.
 *      It can be changed through ICCPs and new flash pools added in the protocol.
 *      Since Solidity doesn't support fractions the weight is defined by the division of
 *      pool weight by total pools weight (sum of all registered pools within the factory).
 * @dev For ILV Pool we use 200 as weight and for ILV/ETH SLP pool - 800.
