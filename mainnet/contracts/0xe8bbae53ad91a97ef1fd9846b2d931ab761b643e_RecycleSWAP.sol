 Initial Supply: 369,888,369,888 RCX
 NAME: RecycleSwap
 Symbol: RCX

RecycleSWAP (RCX) Project is a recycling solution.
The mechanism will authorize the dead coin and token
holders, to transfer their coins to the RecycleSWAP and 
get its tradable coin instead. This will be at restored 
value to individual holders who can sell, trade, stake, 
liquidate tokens into pools, or circulate their RecycleSWAP 
tokens in to the market, and the recycling of project assets 
back into the community.
 
Regarding to the conceptual description of recycling, and 
its multifunction methodologies, it is clear that the main 
reason of RecycleSWAP Project is economics and the potential 
behind its recycleing strategy, considering the technical 
requirements it's supposed to fullfil. The RecycleSWAP is 
going to perform an economic task that no other asset could 
carry out since the birth of Bitcoin.
RecycleSWAP tokens have potential to restore a portion of 
the value from other currencies that were reduced because 
of lack of the demand, or lost by a rug pull from its 
developers or large holders. 

Proposed Solution
-----------------
1. Revaluation of dead coin and tokens.
2. Set up a system to restore and transfer this trapped value 
in a user-friendly platform.
3. RecycleSWAP Token is a convertible token to transferable 
real coin.
4. RecycleSWAP Token Holders can trade their valueless tokens 
and coins into Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solano, and other leading 
cryptocurrencies will be listed @ RCX Official Website.
5. Unifying of failed and dead coin holders, will permit the 
RecycleSWAP Project to clean up the market, and effectively 
eliminate the remaining coins to retain their value.
6. RecycleSWAP is the fast and effective way to reform and 
rehabilitate the value of the market.
7. RecycleSWAP holders will have an opportunity to reinvest 
their regenerated tokens to tradable cryptocurrency projects.
8. RecycleSWAP aims to implement and integrate projects, with 
the power of its holders.


Tokenomics
----------
 10% First stage ICO
 30% Add Liquidity to the market
 25% R&D
 30% Reserve in contract (Control value of coin)
 5% Reserve for the future partners and exchangers


At this point, it should be clear to any holder that listing 
RecycleSWAP on exchanges is a critical element in the success 
of this phase of the RecycleSWAP project. Without listing, 
RecycleSWAP cannot offer a proper gateway to our communities
in order to release value of their dead tokens and coins, into 
the market. 
Although there are no guarantees that any cryptocurrency or 
token will ever get listed on any exchange, the RecycleSWAP 
team has been holding talks with various exchanges to list 
RecycleSWAP (RCX) token once it enters the market.
