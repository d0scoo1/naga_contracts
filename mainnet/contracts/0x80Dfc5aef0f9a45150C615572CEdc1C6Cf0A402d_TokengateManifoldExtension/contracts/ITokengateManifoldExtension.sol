/**
 * @title An extension for Manifold Creator contracts that allows the various NFT marketplaces run by
 * DSENT AG to mint tokens on behalf of a creator. The extension ensures that only a limited number of
 * editions can be minted for any given project. A project in the context of this extension serves as
 * a general term for a wide range of collectibles such as artworks, PFPs, club memberships, etc.
 * Projects can either be minted as single editions or editions of a series with a predefined maximum size.

 *
 * Token URI Generation:
 * ---------------------
 * The logic used to generate a URI for a specified token id uses one of three approaches
 * based on the provided token URI data. Token URI data is always specified using `isFullTokenURI` and
 * `tokenURIData` parameters. If `isFullTokenURI == true` then `tokenURIData` will be interpreted as a
 * complete token URI and no further concatenation logic will be applied. For `isFullTokenURI == false`
 * the `tokenURIData` is used as a URI suffix and is concatenated with a URI prefix to form a complete
 * token URI.
 *
 * Token URI data can either be specified during minting or afterwards using either `setTokenURIData()`
 * or its batch variant `setTokenURIDataBatch()`.
 *
 * The three approaches for URI generation work as follows:
 *
 * 1. If no specific token URI data is specified, the base token URI is concatenated with the creator
 * address and the token id to form a complete URI.
 *
 * 2. If a token URI suffix is specified for a given token, then that suffix gets concatenated with
 * a token URI prefix to form a complete URI.
 *
 * For all single editions the token URI prefix is read from the default token URI prefix variable.
 * Editions of a series on the other hand can use an optional override of the default prefix that
 * can be specified during `createSeries()` or `setSeriesParams()` calls.
 *
 * A token URI suffix can be defined directly on the token level using the URI data parameters
 * of the minting or `setTokenURIData()`/`setTokenURIDataBatch()` calls. Alternatively, it is also possible to
 * to define a suffix that applies to all editions of a series. Such a suffix can be specified during
 * `createSeries()` or `setSeriesParams()` calls. In the case of a series it is further possible to set
 * `addEditionToTokenURISuffix = true`, which will cause the concatenation logic to append the
 * edition number to the specified suffix. If necessary, an optional `tokenURIExtension` can be
 * specified, in order to append an additional extension after the edition number. This is useful if
 * an endpoint has no proper support for Content-Type headers.
 *
 * It is important to understand that a suffix defined on the token level will always take precedence
 * over one defined on a series level.
 *
 * 3. If a full token URI is specified for a given token, then that full URI takes precedence over
 * everything else. It will override a suffix that might be specified for that token.
 *
 * A full token URI must be defined directly on the token level using the URI data parameters
 * of the minting or `setTokenURIData()`/`setTokenURIDataBatch()` calls.
