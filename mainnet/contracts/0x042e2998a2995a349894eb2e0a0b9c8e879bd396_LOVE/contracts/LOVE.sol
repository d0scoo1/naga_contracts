//                                                                                                                   //
//    The nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms,       //
//    such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality. This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual            //
//    orientation…There is dignity in the bond between two men or two women who seek to marry and in their           //
//    autonomy to make such profound choices.                                                                        //
//                                                                                                                   //
//    Marriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there.         //
//    It offers the hope of companionship and understanding and assurance that while both still live there           //
//    will be someone to care for the other.                                                                         //
//                                                                                                                   //
//    No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion,       //
//    sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were.    //
//    As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past      //
//    death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea      //
//    is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves.        //
//    Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest            //
//    institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.      //
//                                                                                                                   //
//                                                                                                                   //
