/**
 * @title  Non-Dilutive 721
 * @author nftchance
 * @notice This token was created to serve as a proof for a conversational point. Non-dilutive 721 
 *         tokens can exist. Teams can easily build around this concept. Teams can additionally  
 *         still monetize the going ons and hard work of their team. However, that does not need to 
 *         come at the cost of their holders. As it stands every token drop following the 
 *         initial is a holder mining experience in which every single holders is impacted by the 
 *         lower market concentration of liquidty and attention.
 * @notice If you plan on yoinking this code. Please message me. Curiosity breeds progress. I am 
 *         here to help if you need or want it. I do not want a cut; I do not want paid. I want a 
 *         market of * honest and holder thoughtful devs. This is a very very weird 721 
 *         implementation and comes with many nuances. I'd love to discuss.
 * @notice Doodles drop of the Spaceships by wrapping into a new token is 100% dilutive.
 * @dev The extendable 'Generations' wrap the token metadata within the content to remove the need 
 *         of dropping another token into the collection. By doing this, that does not inherently
 *         mean the metadata is mutable beyond the extent that the token holder can change the
 *         active metadata. The underlying generations still much exist and can be configured in a 
 *         way that allows accessing them again if desired. However, there does also exist the 
 *         ability to have truly immutable layers that cannot be removed. (If following this
 *         implementation it is vitally noted that object permanence must be achieved from day one.
 *         A project CANNOT implement this on a mutable URL that is massive holder-trust betrayal.)
