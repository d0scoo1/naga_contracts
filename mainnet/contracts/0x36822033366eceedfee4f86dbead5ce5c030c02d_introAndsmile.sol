    /* Yes, hello, average Jane here.

    In 2014, I went to the University of Illinois.
    For a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering + Atmospheric Sciences.
    This led to the fondest of times at the Arecibo Observatory - brainchild of Carl Sagan.
    Where I used lidar and radar systems to look at electrons and Sodium in the sky.
    Prior to it getting demolished in 2019 #thxNSF.

    After graduation, I moved to Silicon Valley.
    Here, I worked on NFC in the Pixel 5 [Android Pay]
    + Bluetooth in the pixel buds for the next 3 years.
    However, my favorite thing ever, 
    was the ABC.XYZ "moonshot" bal-LOON [prior to its shutdown in 2020].
    Where I conducted experiments with a radar facility in Peru!
    to provide internet to remote and disaster stricken areas.

    Why do all good things come to an end ?

    Unfortunately or.. fortunately, in 2021 I was forced to leave the US 
    owing to US work visa lottery #thxP(X_h1b)=0.15.
    Current job: Compute at global scale [w Warszawie, Polska].
    Nodes, RPCs, automated billing in Fiat.
    
    Here we are. Here we are, it is April 2022.
