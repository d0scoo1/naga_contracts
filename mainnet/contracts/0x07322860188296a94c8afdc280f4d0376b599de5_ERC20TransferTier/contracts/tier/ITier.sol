/// @title ITier
/// @notice `ITier` is a simple interface that contracts can
/// implement to provide membership lists for other contracts.
///
/// There are many use-cases for a time-preserving conditional membership list.
///
/// Some examples include:
///
/// - Self-serve whitelist to participate in fundraising
/// - Lists of users who can claim airdrops and perks
/// - Pooling resources with implied governance/reward tiers
/// - POAP style attendance proofs allowing access to future exclusive events
///
/// @dev Standard interface to a tiered membership.
///
/// A "membership" can represent many things:
/// - Exclusive access.
/// - Participation in some event or process.
/// - KYC completion.
/// - Combination of sub-memberships.
/// - Etc.
///
/// The high level requirements for a contract implementing `ITier`:
/// - MUST represent held tiers as a `uint`.
/// - MUST implement `report`.
///   - The report is a `uint256` that SHOULD represent the block each tier has
///     been continuously held since encoded as `uint32`.
///   - The encoded tiers start at `1`; Tier `0` is implied if no tier has ever
///     been held.
///   - Tier `0` is NOT encoded in the report, it is simply the fallback value.
///   - If a tier is lost the block data is erased for that tier and will be
///     set if/when the tier is regained to the new block.
///   - If a tier is held but the historical block information is not available
///     the report MAY return `0x00000000` for all held tiers.
///   - Tiers that are lost or have never been held MUST return `0xFFFFFFFF`.
/// - SHOULD implement `setTier`.
///   - Contracts SHOULD revert with `SET_TIER` error if they cannot
///     meaningfully set a tier directly.
///     For example a contract that can only derive a membership tier by
///     reading the state of an external contract cannot set tiers.
///   - Contracts implementing `setTier` SHOULD error with `SET_ZERO_TIER`
///     if tier 0 is being set.
/// - MUST emit `TierChange` when `setTier` successfully writes a new tier.
///   - Contracts that cannot meaningfully set a tier are exempt.
///
/// So the four possible states and report values are:
/// - Tier is held and block is known: Block is in the report
/// - Tier is held but block is NOT known: `0` is in the report
/// - Tier is NOT held: `0xFF..` is in the report
/// - Tier is unknown: `0xFF..` is in the report

    /// Every time a tier changes we log start and end tier against the
    /// account.

    ///
    /// The contract that implements `ITier` is responsible for checking
    /// eligibility and/or taking actions required to set the tier.
    ///
    /// For example, the contract must take/refund any tokens relevant to
    /// changing the tier.
    ///
    /// Obviously the user is responsible for any approvals for this action
    /// prior to calling `setTier`.

    /// ```
    /// event TierChange(address account, uint startTier, uint endTier);

    ///
    /// The `setTier` function includes arbitrary data as the third
    /// parameter. This can be used to disambiguate in the case that
    /// there may be many possible options for a user to achieve some tier.
    ///
    /// For example, consider the case where tier 3 can be achieved
    /// by EITHER locking 1x rare NFT or 3x uncommon NFTs. A user with both
    /// could use `data` to explicitly state their intent.
    ///
    /// NOTE however that _any_ address can call `setTier` for any other
    /// address.
    ///
    /// If you implement `data` or anything that changes state then be very
    /// careful to avoid griefing attacks.
    ///
    /// The `data` parameter can also be ignored by the contract implementing
    /// `ITier`. For example, ERC20 tokens are fungible so only the balance
    /// approved by the user is relevant to a tier change.
    ///
    /// The `setTier` function SHOULD prevent users from reassigning
    /// tier 0 to themselves.

    /// funds/NFTs etc.

    /// reports from other onchain data.
    /// In this case they should `revert("SET_TIER");`.
