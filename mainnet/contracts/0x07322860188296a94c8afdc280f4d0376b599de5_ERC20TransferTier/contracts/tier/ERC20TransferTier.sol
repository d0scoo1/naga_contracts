/// @title ERC20TransferTier
/// @notice `ERC20TransferTier` inherits from `ReadWriteTier`.
///
/// In addition to the standard accounting it requires that users transfer
/// erc20 tokens to achieve a tier.
///
/// Data is ignored, the only requirement is that the user has approved
/// sufficient balance to gain the next tier.
///
/// To avoid griefing attacks where accounts remove tiers from arbitrary third
/// parties, we `require(msg.sender == account_);` when a tier is removed.
/// When a tier is added the `msg.sender` is responsible for payment.
///
/// The 8 values for gainable tiers and erc20 contract must be set upon
/// construction and are immutable.
///
/// The `_afterSetTier` simply transfers the diff between the start/end tier
/// to/from the user as required.
///
/// If a user sends erc20 tokens directly to the contract without calling
/// `setTier` the FUNDS ARE LOST.
///
/// @dev The `ERC20TransferTier` takes ownership of an erc20 balance by
/// transferring erc20 token to itself. The `msg.sender` must pay the
/// difference on upgrade; the tiered address receives refunds on downgrade.
/// This allows users to "gift" tiers to each other.
/// As the transfer is a state changing event we can track historical block
/// times.
/// As the tiered address moves up/down tiers it sends/receives the value
/// difference between its current tier only.
///
/// The user is required to preapprove enough erc20 to cover the tier change or
/// they will fail and lose gas.
///
/// `ERC20TransferTier` is useful for:
/// - Claims that rely on historical holdings so the tiered address
///   cannot simply "flash claim"
/// - Token demand and lockup where liquidity (trading) is a secondary goal
/// - erc20 tokens without additonal restrictions on transfer
