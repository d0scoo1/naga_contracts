/**
 * @title Raid Party pending rewards batch collection
 * @author xanewok.eth
 * @dev
 *
 * Batch claiming can be optionally:
 * - (`taxed` prefix) taxed by an external entity such as guilds and/or
 * - (`To` suffix) collected into a single address to save on gas.
 *
 * Because $CFTI is an ERC-20 token, we still need to approve this contract
 * from each account where we will draw the funds from for spending in order to
 * move the funds - however, since this contract will be (probably) fully
 * authorized to manage the funds, we need to be extra careful where those funds
 * will be withdrawn.
 *
 * To address this issue, we introduce a concept of *operators* (poor man's
 * ERC-777 operators) which are authorized accounts that can act (and withdraw
 * tokens, among others) on behalf of the token *owner* accounts via this contract.
 *
