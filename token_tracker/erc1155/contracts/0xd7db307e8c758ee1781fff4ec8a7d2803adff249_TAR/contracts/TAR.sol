//    The unanimous Declaration of this #RARIGANG Anarchy, When in the Course of historical events, it becomes necessary            //
//    for one people to strengthen the creative bands which have connected them with a certain symbolic entity, and to              //
//    assume among the powers of the earth, the eternal and unhindered desire to collect the artistic wonders of which              //
//    the Laws of Nature and Blockchain entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should         //
//    declare the causes which impel them to Trash.                                                                                 //

//    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that not all #TRASHART is created equal, that it is saturated by its Creator         //
//    with certain alienesque and infinitely-varied visual anomalies, that among these are Toters, Potatoes, Trash Bags,            //
//    Rats, Red-Lipped Frogs, Golden Arches, Glitched Thought-Adventures, and the pursuit of Trashiness. That to secure             //
//    these ocular fantasies, Trash Directorates are instituted among Artists, deriving their just powers from the consent          //
//    of the governed, That whenever any Form of Bond to any form of #TRASHART becomes so cohesive that separation of such          //
//    would prove destructive of these ends, it is the Right, Duty, and Responsibility of the Trash Artists to seek eternal         //
//    preservation of such Bond, and under Oath swear never to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Directorate,          //
//    laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to         //
//    eternalize the Safety of the Bond between Artist and Trash, certifying Happiness permanence. Prudence, indeed, will           //
//    dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; All experience hath           //
//    sh0wn, that Artists will not be disposed to suffer in absence of Trash, regardless whether such evils might be                //
//    sufferable, and will determinedly, and if necessary, forcefully, right themselves by instituting the permanence of            //
//    the Trash bond to which they are naturally and rightfully drawn. When a long train of flagrant abuses and usurpations,        //
//    pursuing invariably the same desires, evinces a design to reduce them under despotic Absolutism, it is their right, it        //
//    is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to appoint themselves as Custodians of their future security. The            //
//    patient sufferance of these Artists shall not be tolerated; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to            //
//    subdue the antiquated state of mind. The history of the Trash-destitute is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations,    //
//    all having in direct object the establishment of a Tyranny over #TRASHART. Let the necessary Trash Dependence be frankly      //
//    demonstrated henceforth to a candid world through a gift of cognition, whereas to write the following stimuli to the          //

//    and that they have all but officially declared warfare on the Trash Artists, and that by way of social manipulation,          //

//    with great care, desire, and fortitude, so as to bestow the right of Free Expression, and the right to Abstract Chaos         //
//    generation, and the right to the general Pursuit of Trashiness, lest the Artists be gavaged with sufferance beyond a          //
//    level worthy of Disruption of Peace and coordinated uprising; so that they may be free to thrive in a State of full           //
//    #TRASHART immersion.                                                                                                          //

//    We have warned that attempts, however futile, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over #TRASHART would end only with      //
//    inevitable revolution and the subsequent rise to power of Trash. We have appealed to their native justice and                 //
//    magnanimity, in such seeking to provide a deeply personal understanding of the Trash Effect, so defined as a multi            //
//    powerful force, the creation from which it originates a transcendence of le domaine physique conjured by the ties of our      //
//    common kindred to disavow these usurpations. They have been deaf in all manner to the voice of rightful expression and of     //
//    consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity to hold them accountable, and to mourn in victorious            //
//    laughter as we watch the dumpster fire illuminate the entropic night above us, yet owing a duty to the rest of humankind,     //
//    Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.                                                                                             //

//    rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Sanctity of Trash, solemnly publish and declare, that all Trash      //
//    will bask in the glory of vindication; and that Trash Artists are, and of Right ought to be unhindered in expression and      //
//    unslandered in character; and that they are Absolved from all falsehoods raised against them by their cynics; and that as     //
//    Free and Independent Creators, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract collaboration, and establish        //
//    community and governance. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Trash            //
