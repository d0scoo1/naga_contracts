/*
  Each TurfShop object's mint can be configured to refer to an external contract for eligiblity checks.
  This way we can arrange mints' "allow list" flexibly as the need arises, without having to hard code
  all possible situations in the primary TurfShop contract.

  For example, we might want a "Get a free item for every Turf plot you own" give away,
  which would entail that a Checker contract get a user's balance from the original Turf contract.

  Or we might just have a snapshot of some arbitrary data, stored in a Merkle Tree.

  Or maybe we want to interface with another community's contract, etc.

  Either way, we can develop that later, on a per-Turf Object basis.

  In our "get a plant for every Turf Plot" example, we'd return (true, 5)
  for a person that held 5 plots. This would inform TurfShop.sol to give that person
  5 plants. Or, if they held no Turf Plots, we'd return (false, 0).
