     * @dev The idea of boosting power is that
     * we calculate the amount of weeks since it
     * was 100% and we substract 5% power from each week.
     *
     * So we calculate each week from powerCycleStart
     * and for each one we remove 5% boosting power
     *
     * When someone refills boosting power we add the amount
     * of weeks to the start time corresponding to the amount
     * of refills they have done (1 refill = 1 week). This means
     * we add weeks to the powerCycleStart corresponding to the 
     * amount of refills.
     *
     * When we refill the bee we always refill fully. Meaning
     * If you refill right before you lose another 5% you will
     * get your original 5% back and start the counter again from 0.
     *
     * When someone unstakes we save the amount of boosting weeks
     * the bee has left. When someone stakes later we set the cycle start
     * such that the boosting weeks match again. We store the seconds difference
     * from blocktime and unstake time and when staked again we make sure
     * the difference between cycle start and blocktime is those seconds.
     *
     * This way ^^ the bee doesn't lose power when unstaked.
