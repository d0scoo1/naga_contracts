 * @dev Implementation of the NFT Royalty Standard, a standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information.
 * Implementation based off of OpenZeppelin's ERC2981.sol, with significant customization.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: ERC-2981 only specifies a way to signal royalty information and does not enforce its payment. See
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#optional-royalty-payments[Rationale] in the EIP. Marketplaces are expected to
 * voluntarily pay royalties together with sales, but note that this standard is not yet widely supported.
