/**
 * @dev ERC721 token with storage based token URI management.
 *
 * This contract is almost entirely based on the OpenZeppelin implementation, but
 * it modifies the tokenURI() function because we don't think the contract should dictate
 * whether the metadata MUST all live in the same folder structure off-chain. The
 * developer should be able to decide if one token lives in one folder, and another
 * token is in an different folder. However, because OpenZeppelin's implementation
 * concatenates each token's URI with the baseURI (if it exists), their implementation
 * is not able to meet the following criteria:
 *   - have a base URI where any non-customized NFTs will have their metadata
 *   - allow any customized NFTs to have their metadata at an arbitrary
 *     location (this could be a separate folder or separate infrastructure entirely
 *     from the rest of the collection. Maybe not, but the choice should be available
 *     to the developer; the contract should be agnostic and not enforce the same
 *     location for all.)
 * For example, the openzeppelin implementation would make it very difficult to
 * change the metadata about one NFT in the collection if all NFT's metadata were initially
 * uploaded as a folder to IPFS.
