/**
 * @title VaultFactory
 * @author Non-Fungible Technologies, Inc.
 *
 * The Vault factory is used for creating and registering AssetVault contracts, which
 * is also an ERC721 that maps "ownership" of its tokens to ownership of created
 * vault assets (see OwnableERC721).
 *
 * Each Asset Vault is created via "intializeBundle", and uses a specified template
 * and the OpenZeppelin Clones library to cheaply deploy a new clone pointing to logic
 * in the template. The address the newly created vault is deployed to is converted
 * into a uint256, which ends up being the token ID minted.
 *
 * Using OwnableERC721, created Asset Vaults then map their own address back into
 * a uint256, and check the ownership of the token ID matching that uint256 within the
 * VaultFactory in order to determine their own contract owner. The VaultFactory contains
 * conveniences to allow switching between the address and uint256 formats.
